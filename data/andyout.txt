0,and thats what you were going to do in the valley
0,thats where life begins marshes sloughs tidepools he was fascinated by them you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs youd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty he made this city
0,havent the faintest idea
0,hollie was always fond of tidepools you know what he used to say about them
0,the coroners report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs

0,if you want to hire me i still have to know what you and mulwray were arguing about
0,hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune we were a lot closer than evelyn realized
0,i didnt realize you and hollis were so fond of each other
0,just find the girl mr gittes i think she is frightened and i happen to know hollis was fond of her id like to help her if i can

0,who said that gary cooper james stewart henry fonda huh
0,do like the soldier toto go away this land is cursed when youre here every day you feel like youre at the center of the universe it seems like nothing ever changes then you go away one year twoand when you come back everythings different the thread has broken you dont find those you were looking for your things no longer exist isnt that the caseyouve got to go away a long time for many many years before coming back and finding your people again the land where you were bornbut not now its impossible now youre blinder than i am
0,now i understand why the soldier went away just before the end thats right just one more night and the princess would have been his but she also could not have kept her promise andthat would have been terrible he would have died from it so instead for ninetynine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him
0,listen to this onethe commander says to the sergeant you remember that windmill that used to be there yes sir i remember the mills gone but the winds still there you remember the story of the soldier and the princess
0,it was probably meant to be like this each of us has a star to follow so now what are you thinking of doing
0,no and nobody knows where she is
0,did you ever see her again
0,toto sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing so its better to shut up its hot in here toto take me to the beach
0,they tell me you never go out never talk to anybody why
0,you re thinneryou can tell youve not been treated well
0,no nobody came
0,im here take it easy take it easy sit down sit down did she come
0,but whered you go toto
0,you were expecting her huh its a nasty business waiting by yourself in company its better nothen ill leave
0,no alfredo i was coming to help you
0,you werent expecting me
0,could bebut i dont like this business it smells fishy to me
0,just so alfredo there isnt any and if you buy a television set you can watch it at home without any fuss
0,toto are you pulling my leg or something how is it possible to see this television without film
0,no you mean right at the end alfredo thats right toto right at the end and dont ask me what it means if you figure it out let me know
0,i want to make you happy toto im going to tell you a story once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm basta one of the guards saw the kings daughter she was the loveliest of all and he immediately fell in love with her but what could a poor soldier do compared with a kings daughterone day he managed to meet her and told her he couldnt live without her the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony then in the end ill be yours christ the soldier ran off there and waited one day two days ten twentyevery night she looked out of her window but he never budged come rain wind snow never budged the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldnt hold them back he didnt even have the strength to sleep any more the princess kept watchand on the ninetyninth night the soldier got up picked up his chair and left
0,you see it s like i say you always have an answer for everything
0,heeey totooooo dont get pissed off with me now come here i dont know where the fuck i have to go and the next time be careful how you talk not to take credit away from the lord but if i had created the world in all modesty certain things would have come out better but unfortunately such was not the case
0,stop it ive had enough of your sermons you act as if you created the world
0,dont think about it toto dont even try with feelings theres nothing to understand
0,but why there must be some way to make her understand
0,i told you the blueeyed ones are the most difficult
0,theyre not my words john wayne said it in shepherd of the hills
0,what you say is wonderful but sad
0,eh lovewhat a mystery i understand you totothe ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful whatever you do you cant make friends with them eh theres nothing to be done about it the heavier a man is the deeper his footprints and if hes in love he suffers because he knows hes up a oneway street because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants
0,whats she like whats she like
0,yes its a girl i saw at the station
0,is there a womantell me the truth there is a woman
0,nothing theres nothing its all out of focus

0,yes
0,ive shown it so many times i know it by heart the first time i showed it in 1940 was the sunday my first wife died they kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldnt have to close down the movie house i only found out that night after the last show those are things you never forget so toto how are these home movies going

0,mr leland why didnt you go to europe with him he wanted you to he said to me just yesterday

0,do we stand for the same things that the chronicle stands for mr bernstein
0,sure theyre like anybody else they got work to do they do it only they happen to be the best men in the business
0,mr bernstein these men who are now with the enquirer who were with the chronicle until yesterday werent they just as devoted to the chronicle kind of paper as they are now to our kind of paper
0,whats the matter
0,yes
0,isnt it wonderful such a party
0,certainly not
0,do you mr leland
0,that looks pretty nice
0,sixtytwo thousand
0,you just made the paper over four times today mr kane thats all
0,charlie
0,wasted
0,its three hours and fifty minutes late but we did it
0,well be on the street soon charlie another ten minutes
0,who said anything about brooms
0,im not guaranteeing a thing mr bernstein you people work too fast for me talk about new brooms
0,but mr kane i meant
0,it is accepted mr carter with assurances of my deepest regard
0,ive been a newspaperman my whole life and i dont intend if its your intention that i should continue to be harassed by this this i warn you mr kane it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly but i would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted
0,thatll be all today mr carter youve been most understanding good day mr carter
0,but mr kane
0,really mr kane i cant see the function of a respectable newspaper
0,thats the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on mr carter right now i wish youd send your best man up to see mr silverstone have him tell mr silverstone if he doesnt produce his wife at once the enquirer will have him arrested have him tell mr silverstone hes a detective from the central office if mr silverstone asks to see his badge your man is to get indignant and call mr silverstone an anarchist loudly so that the neighbors can hear
0,its not our function to report the gossip of housewives if we were interested in that kind of thing mr kane we could fill the paper twice over daily
0,the chronicle doesnt say shes murdered mr carter it says the neighbors are getting suspicious
0,as a matter of fact we sent a man to the silverstone home yesterday afternoon our man even arrived before the chronicle reporter and theres no proof that the woman was murdered or even that shes dead
0,if the headline is big enough it makes the new big enough the murder of mrs harry silverstone
0,there is no news big enough
0,im still hungry brad lets go to rectors and get something decent the chronicle has a twocolumn headline mr carter why havent we
0,because were running a newspaper mr kane not a scandal sheet
0,im not criticizing mr carter but heres what i mean theres a front page story in the chronicle and a picture of a woman in brooklyn who is missing probably murdered a mrs harry silverstone why didnt the enquirer have that this morning
0,thats one of the things i think must be changed mr carter the news goes on for twentyfour hours a day
0,but a morning newspaper mr kane after all were practically closed twelve hours a day except for the business offices
0,im going to live right here as long as i have to
0,my little sanctum is at your disposal but i dont think i understand

0,im sure thats it
0,thank you i cant imagine how mrs kane came to make such a silly mistake the sedative dr wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle i suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her
0,the nurse has complete instructions but if you care to talk to me at any time i should be only too glad i shall be here in the morning
0,id rather mr kane withdrew without having to get the story published not that i care about him but id be better off that way and so would you mrs kane
0,you dont have to show me anything mr rogers i believe you
0,the story about him and miss alexander mrs kane
0,what story mr rogers
0,i think i understand mr rogers but i wonder if
0,im protecting myself every way i know how mrs kane this last week i finally found out how i can stop your husband from being elected if the people of this state learn what i found out this week he wouldnt have a chance to he couldnt be elected dog catcher well what im interested in is seeing that hes not elected i dont care whether they know what i know about him let him keep right on being the great noble moral champeen of the people just as long as

0,emily youre being a little unfair you know what i think of charles behavior about your personal lives
0,why should anyone vote for him hes made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them children to be told one thing one day something else the next as the whim seizes him and theyre supposed to be grateful and love and adore him because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars

0,youve made your point perfectly clear mr kane good day
0,im much obliged mr president for your concern about me however i happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the united states and i say that if this lease goes through the property of the people of the united states goes into the hands of
0,i understand that you have political ambitions unfortunately you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own
0,thanks
0,i know the facts mr kane and i happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean youre a man of great talents mr kane
0,its the only vein i know i tell the facts the way i see them and any man that knows that facts
0,i must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein mr kane
0,im not suggesting anything mr president ive come here to tell you that unless some action is taken promptly and you are the only one who can take it the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks
0,it is the unanimous opinion of my cabinent in which i concur that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the governement and the people you are not i hope suggesting that these interests are not indentical
0,you cant
0,mr kane how can i persuade you
0,if youre interested in what people say signor matisti i may be able to enlighten you a bit the newspapers for instance im an authority on what the papers will say signor matisti because i own eight of them between here and san francisco its all right dear signor matisti is going to listen to reason arent you maestro
0,but it is impossible i will be the laughingstock of the musical world people will say
0,your job isnt to give mrs kane your opinion of her talents youre supposed to train her voice nothing more
0,impossible impossible
0,youre right we did lose a million dollars last year
0,i happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday charles could i not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise this enquirer that is costing you one million dollars a year
0,on the other hand i am the publisher of the enquirer as such it is my duty ill let you in on a little secret it is also my pleasure to see to it that decent hardworking people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money mad pirates because god help them they have no one to look after their interests ill let you in on another little secret mr thatcher i think im the man to do it you see i have money and property
0,charles my time is too valuable for me
0,as charles foster kane who has 			eighty two thousand six hundred and thirtyone shares of metropolitan transfer you see i do have a rough idea of my holdings i sympathize with you charles foster kane is a dangerous scoundrel his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him you may if you can form such a committee put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars
0,the trouble is mr thatcher you dont realize youre talking to two people
0,theyre all part of your general attack your senseless attack on everything and everybody whos got more than ten cents in his pocket theyre
0,mr thatcher isnt everything ive been saying in the enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true
0,wont you step into my office mr thatcher
0,i came to see you charles about your about the enquirers campaign against the metropolitan transfer company

0,you see there hasnt been a true word
0,can you prove it isnt

0,hello charlie i didnt know we were speaking
0,hello brad
0,i couldnt possibly live on as little as that charlie well let the salary stay where it is
0,well youve been getting a pretty low salary here in new york it seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our chicago paper should get what hes worth
0,yes
0,you still want to be transferred to the other paper
0,hey brad ive been analyzed an awful lot tonight lets have another brandy
0,i know you will
0,she can leave me as a matter of fact ive already left her dont worry brad ill live
0,its simpler than that brad a society girl cant stand the gaff thats all other things are important to her social position what theyre saying on the front porches at southampton is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner
0,you want love on your own terms dont you charlie love according to your own rules and if anything goes wrong and youre hurt then the game stops and youve got to be soothed and nursed no matter what else is happening and no matter who else is hurt
0,nothing if she dosent love me
0,thats all right what are you going to do about emily
0,youre not going to like it in chicago they wind comes howling in from the lake and theres practically no opera season at all and the lord only knows whether theyve ever heard of lobster newburg
0,yes now will you let me go to chicago
0,are you finished
0,you talk about the people of the united states as though they belonged to you when you find out they dont think they are youll lose interest you talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty remember the working man you used to defend him quite a good deal well hes turning into something called organized labor and you dont like that at all and listen when your precious underprivileged really get together thats going to add up to something bigger than than your privilege and then i dont know what youll do sail away to a desert island probably and lord it over the monkeys
0,you almost convince me im just drunk enough to tell you the truth i have to be a little drunk for that because im a coward you know that thats why you keep me around you only associate with your inferiors charlie i guess thats why you ran away from emily because you cant stand the company of your equals you dont like to admit they exist the other big people in your world are dead i told you that
0,the personal note is all there is to it its all there ever is to it its all there every is to anything stupidity in our government complacency and selfsatisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong you cant fight those things impersonally theyre not impersonal crimes against people theyre being done by actual persons with actual names and positions and the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue brad that you debate and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers
0,theres no reason why this this savage personal note
0,you might have made the whole thing less personal
0,do you think the enquirer shouldnt have campaigned against the oil leases
0,she hasnt any friends left sine you started this oil business and she never sees you
0,why is she leaving me
0,sure i am she wants full custody of the child no matter what happens if you wont agree to that shell apply for a divorce regardless of the presidents wishes i cant tell her shes wrong because she isnt wrong
0,brad you are drunk
0,emilys going south next week with the child as far as anybodys to know its a holiday when they get back
0,she was going to leave you anyway
0,i dont think so brad weve just had word that the president is out of danger it seems i didnt kill him after all
0,shes going to leave you
0,all right
0,no that wont help besides you never get drunk i wanted to talk about you and emily
0,ill tell you what ill do brad ill get drunk too maybe thatll help
0,i want to be transferred to the new paper youve been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to thats not what i wanted to talk about
0,why brad
0,charlie its just no go we cant agree anymore i wish youd let me go to chicago
0,thats just a little promotion scheme nobody expects you mike will you try and get mr leland some coffee
0,first of all i will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the enquirer
0,ill get you some coffee
0,im drunk
0,whats wrong brad
0,first of all
0,go ahead
0,id like to talk to you about that
0,ive got to think of emily
0,what
0,i dont have to i run a newspaper with half a million readers and theyre getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast i cant help that besides they all know im married to his niece ive got to think of her
0,charlie now youre not making sense
0,what lesson not to expose fraud when i see it not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property run it the way i said reilly this afternoon a great man was assassinated
0,there are the people of the united states and they are blaming you oh i know it doesnt make any sense but at least you can learn a lesson from it
0,look out that window
0,oil belonging to the people of the united states was leased out for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks nobody can blame me because
0,charlie
0,theyre true everything i said witholding that veto was treason
0,youve said a lot of things about the president in the last few months
0,i said treason was a capital offense punishable by death
0,and that copy of the enquirer said the president should be killed
0,because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the enquirer in his pocket
0,yesterday morning you called the president a traitor what do you think that crowd is doing down there they think you murdered him
0,what do you mean by that
0,why not well nobodys a great man in your estimation until hes dead
0,why not
0,do you think youre the one who should call him a great man
0,yes
0,charlie
0,take dictation front page editorial this afternoon a great man was assassinated he was the president of the united states
0,youre wrong it does make a difference to you rectors brad come to think of it i dont blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent you wont miss anything it isnt much of a war besides they tell me there isnt a decent restaurant on the whole island
0,it doesnt make any difference about me but one of these days youre going to find out that all this charm of yours wont be enough
0,yes
0,charlie
0,you start tomorrow night richard carl in the spring chicken ill get us some girls you get tickets a drama critic gets them free you know rectors at seven
0,id like that
0,you dont want to be a war correspondent how about being a dramatic critic
0,good
0,i mean ive got a job for you
0,yes
0,say brad ive got an idea
0,and i do it because they do it and they do it its a vicious circle isnt it im going over to georgies brad you know georgie dont you
0,they do it only because you do
0,how would the enquirer look with no news about this nonexistent war with benton pulitzer and heart devoting twenty columns a day to it
0,charles i tell you there is no war theres a condition that should be remedied but between that and a
0,all right brad all right you dont have to be a war correspondent unless you want to id want to hello georgie
0,but there is no front charlie theres a very doubtful civil war besides i dont want the job
0,itll be our first foreign war in fifty years brad well cover it the way the hickville gazette covers the church social the names of everybody there what they wore what they ate who won the prizes who gave the prizes i tell you brad i envy you by bradford leland the enquirers special correspondent at the front im almost tempted
0,our readers are anyway i dont know about the rest of the country
0,well gentlemen are we going to war
0,its a good idea for a newspaper four hundred sixy thousand
0,the chronicle is a good newspaper
0,people are going to know whos responsible and theyre going to get the news the true news quickly and simply and entertainingly and no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news
0,thats the second sentence youve started with i
0,whatre you going to do charlie
0,ive changed the front page a little mr bernstein thats not enough theres something ive got to get into this paper besides pictures and print ive got to make the new york enquirer as important to new york as the gas in that light
0,a wasted day
0,its been a tough day
0,tired
0,what makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid something inflexible that people are supposed to pay two cents for
0,poor mr carter
0,i think its beginning to dawn on mr rogers that i mean what i say with mr rogers out of the way reilly i think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state well mr bernstein
0,rogers isnt even pretending he isnt just scared anymore hes sick frank norris told me last night he hasnt known rogers to be that worried in twentyfive years
0,it does seem too good to be true doesnt it mr bernstein
0,it was for twentyfive thousand dollars
0,oh yes the bonus
0,you made it out to him last week after he left for chicago
0,what check
0,mr leland sent back that check

0,ill sign those papers
0,hey nurse
0,sure mr leland ill be glad to
0,on your way out stop at a cigar store will you and send me up a couple of cigars
0,sure
0,i dont know he was disappointed in the world so he built one of his own an absolute monarchy it was something bigger than an opera house anyway nurse say ill tell you one thing you can do for me young fellow
0,that must have been love
0,i guess maybe im not as hard to see through as i think anyway i never even answered his letter maybe i should have i guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years he hadnt finished it when she left him he never finished it he never finished anything of course he built it for her
0,yes
0,well thats about all there is and im getting chills hey nurse five years ago he wrote from that place of his down south you know shangrila el dorado sloppy joes whats the name of that place you know all right xanadu i knew what it was all the time you caught on didnt you
0,he married for love thats why he did everything thats why he went into politics it seems we werent enough he wanted all the voters to love him too all he really wanted out of life was love thats charlies story its the story of how he lost it you see he just didnt have any to give he loved charlie kane of course very dearly and his mother i guess he always loved her as for emily well all i can tell you is emilys story as she told it to me which probably isnt fair theres supposed to be two sides to every story and i guess there are i guess theres more than two sides
0,was he in love
0,brief marriage ten years
0,i am in receipt of your favor of yesterday i beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that mrs whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of charles foster kane she has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget with assurances of the highest esteem
0,he knows the first mrs kane socially thats the answer we got
0,oh yes i know about mr rawlston
0,rawlston is my boss
0,david grobleski davis my dear rawlston
0,its a letter from her lawyers

0,i can remember everything thats my curse young man its the greatest curse thats ever been inflicted on the human race memory i was his oldest friend as far as i was concerned he behaved like swine maybe i wasnt his friend if i wasnt he never had one maybe i was what nowadays you call a stooge
0,maybe you could remember something that
0,never mind bernstein told you about the first days at the office didnt he well charlie was a bad newspaper man even then he entertained his readers but he never told them the truth
0,sorry mr leland
0,you dont happen to have a cigar do you ive got a young physician must remember to ask to see his license the odds are a hundred to one he hasnt got one who thinks im going to stop smoking i changed the subject didnt i dear dear what a disagreeable old man ive become you want to know what i think of charlie kane well i suppose he has some private sort of greatness but he kept it to himself he never gave himself away he never gave anything away he just left you a tip he had a generous mind i dont suppose anybody ever had so many opinions that was because he had the power to express them and charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it but he didnt believe in anything except charlie kane he never had a conviction in his life i guess he died without one that must have been pretty unpleasant of course a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death but we do know what were leaving we believe in something youre absolutely sure you havent got a cigar
0,mr leland you were

0,bunch of savages in this town hey caitlins in the back you might want to see if shes okay shes been back there a long time
0,who eats cock
0,ill read the book
0,all right but youre missing out chicks with dicks
0,i might be leaving early to go out with caitlin in which case youll have to close the store tonight
0,you want me to bring the vcr over here so we can watch this
0,in my absence try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns
0,youre a snake
0,no dont bring it up i dont want to think about that now let me enjoy this hour of bliss ill think about all of that later in the meantime nobody mentions the v word
0,hey what about veronica
0,this is my way of spitting water at life
0,what happened to title dictates behavior
0,watch the store while i go home and change
0,i feel so ineffectual is there anything i can do for you
0,she went home shes getting ready and were going out
0,wow youve had quite an evening
0,im not
0,youre kidding
0,shes not going to marry that guy she went home to tell her mother
0,what did she say
0,im not she just left
0,now i know youre lying
0,no im happy because caitlin came to see me
0,youre happy to get a fine
0,im happy
0,youre happy
0,because im happy
0,then why arent you like screaming at me right now
0,i swear i couldnt make this kind of hell up
0,youre lying
0,because im here
0,then how come you got the fine
0,as opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here
0,holy shit that girl
0,little girl maybe five years old
0,really
0,i dont you did
0,i thought you never sold cigarettes to kids
0,living proof
0,i didnt think they even enforced this
0,youre bullshitting
0,five hundred dollars
0,no way
0,i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor
0,i like to expand my horizons
0,and this is what you rented
0,hermaphroditic porn starlets with both organs you should see the box beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame
0,whatd you rent best of both worlds
0,get to work
0,i know im your hero
0,please get the hell out of here
0,i like to think im a master of my own destiny
0,youre a danger to both the dead and the living
0,if title dictated my behavior as a clerk serving the public i wouldnt be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy but i did so my point is that people dictate their own behavior hence even though im a clerk in this video store i choose to go rent videos at big choice agreed
0,what
0,and two to make a point title does not dictate behavior
0,jesus
0,two reasons one i hate when the people cant shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines
0,what the fuck did you do that for
0,not yet
0,thats stretching it youre not being asked to slay children or anything
0,exactly
0,the reasons you wont let me borrow your car is because i have a title and a job description and im supposed to follow it right
0,what
0,so your argument is that title dictates behavior
0,its going to have to do for now considering that its my car thats up for request can i help you
0,you know what i dont think i care for your rationale
0,theres a difference those were obligations obligations that could not have been met at any later date now renting videosthats just gratuitous not to mention illogical considering you work in a video store
0,i see so playing hockey and attending wakesthese practices are standard operating procedure
0,we are employees of quick stop convenience and rst video respectively as such we have certain responsibilities whichthough it may seem cruel and unusualdoes include manning our posts until closing
0,if you must
0,may i be blunt with you
0,let me borrow your car
0,can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time
0,you work in a video store
0,whats that for
0,you want to rent a movie
0,i want to rent a movie
0,why should i loan you my car
0,fine just lend me your car
0,i dont want to talk to you
0,let me borrow your car
0,just go go open the video store
0,so theyll put her back in its not like its gonna matter if she breaks something
0,her fucking body fell out
0,so the casket fell over big deal
0,does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose
0,i was just leaning on it it was an accident

0,im telling you it wasnt my fault
0,i cant fucking believe you
0,nobodys there its four oclock on a saturday how many people ever come to the store at four on a saturday
0,i cant help it at least when we were playing hockey outside i could see if anyone wanted to go in
0,listen to you

0,yeah like you said you know i guess everyone tries it sooner of later
0,what your dick
0,you know

0,an embarrassing way to die
0,an embolism in a pool
0,twentytwo same as us
0,she was pretty young hunhh
0,thanks for putting me in a tough spot youre a good friend

0,she meant nothing to you either until i told you she died
0,she meant nothing to you
0,if you go i go
0,dont be an asshole somebody has to stay with the store
0,but i love gatherings isnt it ironic
0,you hate people
0,im not missing whats probably going to be the social event of the season

0,because my exgirlfriend is getting married
0,why not
0,no
0,all of them
0,which ones
0,you know who i can do without i could do without the people in the video store
0,the women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date as if somewherebeyond all the other gallonsis a container of milk that wont go bad for like a decade
0,the milkmaids
0,the milkmaids
0,lets hear it
0,its not really anyone per se its more of separate groupings
0,how can you lie like that why dont you vent vent your frustration come on who pisses you off
0,there arent
0,liar tell me there arent customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis
0,what for they dont bother me if i dont bother them
0,you gotta loosen up my friend youd feel a hell of a lot better if youd rip into the occasional customer
0,im gonna hear it tomorrow
0,who cares that ladys an asshole everybody that comes in here is way too uptight this job would be great if it wasnt for the fucking customers
0,why do you do things like that you know shes going to come back and tell the boss
0,the jizzmoppers job is to clean up the booths afterward because practically everybody shoots a load against the window and i dont know if you know or not but cum leaves streaks if you dont clean it right away
0,can we talk about this later
0,think of the weirdest craziest shit youd like to see chicks do these chicks do it all they insert things into any opening in their body any opening hes led a very sheltered life
0,what kind of show
0,oh its great you step into this little booth and theres this window between you and this naked woman and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks
0,i guess not
0,nudie booth youve never been in a nudie booth
0,nudie booth
0,hes the guy in those nudiebooth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off
0,whats a jizzmopper
0,you know how much money the average jizzmopper make per hour
0,did you ever notice all the prices end in nine damn thats eerie
0,ill give him five more minutes then im calling the cops i dont need this man im not even supposed to be here today
0,its not like you laid the eggs yourself
0,he said it was important to have standards he said nobody has pride anymore
0,what did he say
0,i told him that and he yelled at me
0,why doesnt he just mix and match
0,obviously not look at all the cartons that didnt make the grade
0,the quest isnt going well
0,each egg has to be perfect
0,perfect dozen
0,he said he has to find a perfect dozen
0,whats he looking for
0,this guy is going through all of the eggs look
0,shes in here
0,wait
0,youll never believe what this unruly customer just said
0,all those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed casualties of a war they had nothing to do with all right lookyoure a roofer and some juicy government contract comes your way you got the wife and kids and the twostory in suburbiathis is a government contract which means all sorts of benefits all of a sudden these leftwing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a threemile radius you didnt ask for that you have no personal politics youre just trying to scrape out a living
0,all right so even if independent contractors are working on the death star why are you uneasy with its destruction
0,exactly in order to get it built quickly and quietly theyd hire anybody who could do the job do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main all they know is killing and white uniforms
0,not just imperials is what youre getting at
0,a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer ill bet there were independent contractors working on that thing plumbers aluminum siders roofers
0,so
0,the second time around it wasnt even finished yet they were still under construction
0,and the second time around
0,so when they blew it up no prob evil is punished
0,basically
0,well the thing is the first death star was manned by the imperial army storm troopers dignitariesthe only people onboard were imperials
0,and you figured it out
0,something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it i could never put my finger on itsomething just wasnt right
0,compliments of lando calrissian
0,and the second one was still being built when they blew it up
0,luke blew it up give credit where its due
0,now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it
0,yeah
0,so they build another death star right
0,theres more
0,you know what else i noticed in jedi
0,i think they were catholics
0,the only problem is that at no point in the series did i ever hear leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief
0,more or less
0,hence the empire was a fascist theocracy and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution
0,it would stand to reason yes
0,then wouldnt that logically mean that its a theocracy if the head of the empire is a priest of some sort then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion
0,yeah
0,now hes in charge of the empire the imperial government is under his control and the entire galaxy is under imperial rule
0,i guess
0,well hes like the pope for the dark side of the force hes a holy man a shaman kind of albeit an evil one
0,how do you mean
0,right the emperor now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure yes
0,the emperor
0,all right vaders boss
0,whats that
0,there was something else going on in jedi i never noticed it until today
0,empire had the better ending luke gets his hand cut off and finds out vaders his father han gets frozen and taken away by boba fett it ends on such a down note and thats lifea series of down endings all jedi had was a bunch of muppets
0,blasphemy
0,empire

0,i think its safe to say yes

0,oh yeah
0,because there was a lot of good in our relationship
