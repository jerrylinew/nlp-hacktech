0,the truth is
0,yes thats fine of course i you know of course ill just be getting along then nice to see you
0,can i just say no to your kind request and leave it at that
0,thats fine theres always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict
0,sorry about that

0,but yesterday that actor asked you who i was and you just dismissed me out of hand i heard you had a microphone i had headphones
0,yes the thing is i have to go away today but i wondered if i didnt whether you might let me see you a bit or a lot maybe see if you could like me again

0,what are the choices
0,thats right im at last going out on a date with the great janine and i just want to be sure ive picked the right tshirt

0,oh right
0,yes

0,excuse me
0,no mister harding that is not true
0,is it true mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday
0,yes mister harding
0,yes thank you miss ratched since our last meeting i have been reflecting quite seriously on the nature of my problem naturally im referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain no no to personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function regardless of the function we will confront the question of yes yes the question of existence relationship function confront yes confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis yes the crisis of our souls of our souls which i am trying to fully understand the problem the problem not to shut ourselves off but somehow somehow to understand fully our capacity to obtain to personify the question existence depends depends on the question to reflect to reflect
0,yes mister harding
0,i mean the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having i know that to be the case but the way in which you broached it if thats your idea of teaching me something
0,no secrets mister harding lets get it all out in the open
0,have you ever speculated mister harding that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements
0,i can only speculate as to the reasons why
0,why
0,yes that is correct
0,and yet you suspect her
0,no miss ratched
0,but you have no proof
0,yes miss ratched this is correct
0,am i to take it that there isnt a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter mister harding youve stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men
0,he also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere but he didnt say how he has been heard to say to his wife i hate you i dont ever want to see you again youve betrayed me so does anyone care to touch upon this further
0,yes thats perfectly correct
0,at the close of fridays meeting we were discussing mister hardings problem concerning his wife mister harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street is that correct mister harding

0,peter peter was a mistake an imposter
0,what about peter
0,yeah well obviously it wasnt meant to be ive got fortyeight hours i can still make it home in time to marry dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened
0,and a fortune teller
0,it was a ouija board remember
0,i know but
0,i thought you were the one who didnt think i shouldve come in the first place
0,so youre just quitting just like that
0,why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place children are very impressionable you know
0,okay a lot of bad luck but that means the odds are probably in your favor now this is no time to give up
0,a little bad luck
0,so youve had a little bad luck
0,because ive been kidding myself because i realized you were right from the beginning this whole thing was just a wild goose chase
0,why
0,packing
0,sightseeing whatre you doing
0,hi whereve you been
0,hiiii
0,men have ways
0,but how could he know he only just met me
0,yeah sociopaths theyre able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that
0,dont be silly hows a psychiatrist gonna find him
0,no like a psychiatrist
0,like a detective
0,i think its time we got some professional help
0,i meant about my idea
0,that was really sweet
0,and then we rent a truck or a car either one and we set up a loudspeaker and we drive through the surrounding areas and we page him
0,and then what faith
0,okay heres what i think we find out what all the subway stops for that train are the subway systems really not that big in rome we could narrow it down and
0,well nobody can say we didnt try
0,good luck
0,what
0,faith
0,right okay its meant to be right this is it
0,faith so far youve trailed the man halfway around the globe at this point i dont think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales
0,right right okay you dont think hes gonna think im too aggressive
0,nope
0,is he looking at us
0,hes sitting in the fourth booth down on the left hand side with his back to us hes wearing a navy jacket if you turn around you can see part of his right elbow
0,oh my god where
0,hes heeeeeerrre
0,okay okay you join him but first will you ask if hes here
0,not if you dont count the sixth grade
0,sure you did
0,i never even got to be single
0,because im the one whos single
0,well how come were always looking for guys for you
0,i told you if he sees me here with another guy hes gonna think im here with another guy i just dont want to send any confusing signals
0,so whats in a name i wanna join him i dont see why we cant join him
0,youve travelled over six thousand miles and now youre gonna play hard to get
0,i sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe hed notice me first
0,youre right at least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself smile
0,all of the sudden im feeling kind of nervous god i hate blind dates why couldnt we just have arranged marriages in america
0,whats she saying
0,i dont know i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden
0,what did you say to her
0,right my brother
0,her brother
0,anna im faith you dont know how happy i am to meet you you see im trying to find someone and
0,polo
0,larry bought himself cologne
0,he went out and bought himself mens cologne the other day did i tell you that
0,and you know what i thought then kate i thought i hope someday i have somebody who loves me that much i still hope that
0,that was a long time ago
0,you know when larry and i got married i thought we were so lucky we found each other so early people talk about spending their lives together how many of them really get to but maybe i was wrong maybe sooner or later everything wears out
0,course he does
0,you think he misses me at all
0,i dont know kate i just said that im sorry im just on edge im afraid were losing him
0,so what exactly is larrys side of the story anyway
0,sorry
0,well you dont have to get snippy with me
0,you expecting somebody you know
0,nothing
0,whats that supposed to mean
0,you know no offense or anything kate but i think im starting to see larrys side of the story
0,im hungry
0,right so we shouldve been able to cover more of them
0,we wouldve had enough gas to get us there if you hadnt gotten us lost besides a kilometer is less than a mile
0,i told you a liter was less than a gallon
0,the book said they have a lot of rail strikes in italy
0,couldnt we just have taken a train
0,what was i gonna do tell him the truth

0,only what
0,a phone message only
0,what is it
0,were saved
0,oh right

0,maybe theres fingerprints on it
0,a rich possibly fat slob
0,a butterfinger wrapper
0,whatd you find
0,ah ha
0,so maybe his room hasnt been cleaned yet maybe theres something in there that might help us maybe theyll let us go in and take a look around
0,so
0,the guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago right
0,i just got a dial tone
0,i dont think he understood what you were saying whats the airport number
0,did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned
0,you cant really blame him for being upset it was an armani suit
0,he fell out
0,what are you doing
0,faith ive seen it already okay if i spot somebody whos got a head thats an eighth of an inch around standing underneath a tuba ill recognize him from the photo otherwise im telling you its not gonna do me any good
0,just once more so youll be sure to know what to look for
0,you and the other 99 of the women in the world

0,thank you so much
0,my god you have
0,no i havent and you forgot about the fortune teller

0,i cant believe we did this do i have to remind you that your wedding is in six days
0,of course not i told him i was going to visit a great aunt and dont tell larry either
0,does dwayne know about this
0,would you stop saying that i need you to do me a really big favor

0,you dont have a passport
0,i have vacation time coming to me

0,larry brought me flowers last night
0,kate is something the matter
0,i mean just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that its all supposed to be perfect well guess what it isnt not for you not for anybody
0,i understand kate what do you think of this garter
0,people have problems insecurities flaws and you have to learn to compromise to overlook to forgive its not settling faith its life real life
0,i know youre right
0,let me tell you something about love there are no prince charmings there are no glass slippers love is hard work
0,yeah i guess youre right i really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den
0,but one day you wake up and realize youve been had of course life isnt like the movies thats why there are movies
0,thats the problem when youre a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies dreams come true the good guys win people live happily ever after all that crap turn
0,oh i dont know i guess its just not quite the way i always thought it was going to be you know like in the movies
0,but what
0,i know it was
0,i think it was sweet of him to pick it out
0,look how big it makes me look i look like an alp
0,come on its not so bad
0,well i wouldntve if i hadnt thought i was in love
0,yes you did
0,he begged me to marry him i didnt even want to marry him
0,if youve never been out with him how do you know you dont want to go out with him

0,so whats your point
0,but somebody wrote those songs
0,yes you know all the shrinks on donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds peoples fantasies
0,is everything okay
0,i think if youre honest with yourself youll admit youve had a chance at a number of amana appliances in your lifetime
0,metaphorically i still dont have an amana freezer
0,its a metaphor its women who always think theres some unknown out there thats going to be better than whats in front of them and instead wind up with nothing

0,she is to be bmineb it is so spoken
0,ahh but i declare there is still time for isomeithing

0,i wasnt sure you caught that
0,you waved to me in the elevator
0,i dont know i hadnt worked that part out yet all i knew was that i liked you and i didnt want to leave you there never see you again

0,i called your room from downstairs
0,oh god

0,it doesnt have to its something that happens its like seeing a person you never saw before you could be passing on the street you look at each other and for a few seconds theres a kind of recognition like you both know something but then the next moment the persons gone and its too late to do anything about it but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go and you think what if i had stopped and said something it might happen only a few times in your life
0,well does it make sense to you
0,its not a game something you play
0,its your game ive never played this before
0,i dont think it works if were somebody else you know what i mean gary and celeste jesus what do they know about anything

0,i was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes do you think thats why were meeting to help us say goodbye to rafe
0,that might not have been such a good idea theyre making us fly out of a halfpaved airfield the real punishment is that i wont be back to the barracks till its too late for dinner or coffee so i guess its goodbye for awhile

0,you too lieutenant
0,hello lieutenant good to see you
0,and if we fail and lose our carriers we destroy our ability to fight them at all as soon as the second wave returns we will withdraw
0,if we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots we destroy their ability to operate in the pacific for at least a year
0,the second wave has not returned and we have no idea where their carriers are what is the damage report
0,we have achieved complete surprise the first wave is returning the second is attacking now and we have lost only a few planes we can launch a third wave admiral
0,we must go ahead this is our moment
0,we have a fighter screen up in case we are attacked admiral
0,we have achieved surprise but their carriers are not in port i dont like this
0,a brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war
0,brilliant admiral
0,set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the americans will intercept concerning every potential american target in the pacific include hawaii the clutter will be more confusing that way
0,if we achieve surprise they will offer little resistance
0,everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us
0,i have arranged a live fire drill with your permission
0,uncharged torpedoes have different balance
0,god help them
0,the chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the jap patrols do if any of the planes make it
0,so those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel
0,thereve been some complications sir the chinese didnt receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set and the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway
0,have the planes made it to china
0,we have bombed tokyo mr president radio tokyo interrupted its own broadcast to make the announcement
0,weve done studies were confident we would turn them back eventuallyafter theyd gotten as far as chicago
0,what if the japanese did invade
0,crank her
0,i havena been able ta
0,fook ya dooble
0,learn english then
0,fook ya
0,and if you dont give me a plane that can handle combat you better start learning to speak german
0,if yed wanted a bloody cadillac ya shoulda stayed in the bloody states
0,all of em
0,well which of those three ya want fixed
0,the struts are loose the hydraulics are leaking and the electrical systems shorting out in the cockpit
0,leapin jesus
0,the americans themselves have made it possible we will annihilate them in a single attack at pearl harbor
0,you see us as capable of such a blow
0,the council knows i have opposed fighting the americans no matter how great our resolve they have resources beyond ours if we must go to war there is only one way deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover in that time we can conquer all of the pacific and they will have no choice but to ask for peace
0,you have something to say yamamoto
0,the time has come to strike or to sit and let the americans cut off our oil and our future i know what you whisper to the others yamamoto that the americans are strong yet look at their leader
0,if knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then i have misunderstood what it means to be japanese
0,so you join us admiral some of us thought your education at an american university would make you too weak to fight the americans
