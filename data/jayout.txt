0,look im a victim here too i was a year away from getting my masters in art now ill never graduate my life has been permanently disrupted
0,you seem very savvy for a man whos been found mentally incompetent to stand trial
0,it was my finger that pulled the trigger but im not morally responsible my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of how could i know im not a doctor
0,so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people
0,yes my psychiatrist didnt insist that i stay on my medication
0,your doctor
0,this had nothing to do with shoes that didnt fit or my relationship with my father who as you know made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor
0,were trying to get there i hope we can
0,continued
0,im sorry dr smyslov but im really not at liberty to discuss this
0,continued
0,how did they manage to do that without any communication
0,continued
0,well i suppose theyve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment
0,continued
0,shes wonderful
0,continued
0,im afraid ive only got a few minutes but id love to
0,continued
0,well how nice to see you again elena youre looking wonderful
0,space stattion 5 lounge
0,roger
0,i think ill have to go out and burn them off
0,i guess not
0,i guess you dont know your own strength old boy
0,i didnt do that frank i took particular care not to freeze them
0,well now that weve got one thats actually failed we should be able to figure out whats happened and fix it
0,its the last one
0,yes
0,hal
0,well i hope theres nothing wrong with the assembly on those other wise were out of business
0,two more
0,two units in four days how many spares do we have
0,i dont know hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure
0,no
0,youre kidding
0,well hals reported the aounit about to fail again
0,oh im fine im wide awake whats up
0,are you reasonably awake
0,good morning hows it going
0,anyway its just as well that we replace it better safe than sorry
0,yes but its more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
0,i suppose computers have been known to be wrong
0,yes i dont know what to make of it
0,well thats something
0,still all we have to do is ask hal
0,i guess it isnt
0,i suppose it isnt logically impossible
0,but not completely inconceivable
0,i know it would be almost inconceivable
0,yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us
0,not really though it is strange when you think about it it didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training
0,thats true
0,just ask hal its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal
0,how
0,of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
0,yes i thought so
0,that seems very unlikely
0,i dont know all i heard is that theres something about the mission we werent told
0,oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard
0,no as a matter of fact i didnt
0,yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout
0,oh
0,i suppose so though of course theres a more sinister explanation
0,i suppose the idea was specialized training
0,no i never did either
0,i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
0,i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out
0,well what do you think we ought to do about it
0,its possible
0,not really they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall and that were being charged against differ ent accounting offices
0,yesterday i finally called the accounting office at mission control and all they could tell me was that theyd received the ags19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either
0,yes
0,really
0,interesting that you mention it because ive got the same problem
0,thats right well naturally i didnt say anything to payroll i assumed theyd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque but its been almost three weeks now and im still being paid as an ags18
0,well i got the papers on my official upgrading to ags19 two weeks before we left
0,yes
0,its about my salary cheques
0,whats up
0,well its nothing really important but its annoying
0,sure what is it
0,dave if youve a minute id like your advice on something
0,okay come on down
0,okay
0,right just a sec
0,hi frank coming in please
0,listen to me very carefully hal unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection
0,i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission
0,i am prepared to do that anyway
0,hal unless you follow my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you
0,im sorry dave but in accordance with subroutine c15324 quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it
0,hal im in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control
0,i can tell from the tone of your voice dave that youre upset why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest
0,i dont like to assert myself dave but it would be much better now for you to rest youve been involved in a very stressful situation
0,hal switch to manual hibernation control
0,look dave yourve probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me
0,im goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please
0,if youre determined to revive the crew now i can handle the whole thing myself theres no need for you to trouble
0,i dont really agree with you dave my onboard memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements
0,it doesnt have to be hal its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth let me have manual control please
0,repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation
0,the antenna has to be replaced
0,i suppose its because youve been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that theyre not supposed to be revived for another three months
0,i suppose youre pretty broken up about it
0,yes it is
0,too bad about frank isnt it
0,well thats a relief you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission
0,yes it is hal
0,is your confidence in me fully restored
0,and dont you worry about it
0,well dont worry about it
0,im sorry about the misunderstanding hal
0,naturally dave im not pleased that the aounit has failed but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability i certainly wouldnt want to be disconnected even temporarily as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history
0,okay hal well lets see the way things go from here on
0,look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the aounits and with your test gear
0,hal is there anything bothering you anything that might account for this problem
0,im not questioning your word dave but its just not possible im not capable of being wrong
0,yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail
0,you probably also know that we found them okay
0,yes i know
0,you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition
0,sure dave whats up
0,not now hal id like to talk to you about something
0,i understand hal well take care of it please let me have the hard copy
0,the unit is still operational dave but it will fail within seventytwo hours
0,my fpc shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit
0,what is it hal
0,sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think weve got a problem
0,hes got a point
0,im sorry frank but i dont think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know
0,well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going
0,continued
0,still you really dont believe it do you
0,continued
0,well its silly but if you want to why dont you
0,coninued
0,well what is it
0,continued
0,did they have any explanation for this
0,continued
0,yes i remember you mentioning it i got mine about the same time
0,continued
0,goodbye daddy
0,bye bye now sweetheart
0,yes daddy
0,ill wish you a happy birthday now and ill see you soon all right darling
0,thank you daddy
0,okay sweetheart have a lovely birthday party tomorrow

0,im having a party tomorrow
0,im fine daddy when are you coming home
0,im at space station five darling how are you
0,ill bet its a fortune
0,i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty
0,yes well whatever it is theyre certainly not fooling around this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week
0,berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight
0,i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
0,well ive heard more and more people talk of an epidemic
0,well hows it going back there
0,thank you
0,oh thank you very much
0,thank you its been a great pleasure to meet all of you dr smyslov
0,well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you
0,well i hope that you and your wife can come to the iac conference in june
0,no thank you and im afraid now i really must be going
0,are you sure you wont change your mind about a drink
0,well that does sound very odd
0,clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal
0,well where are all of you off to
0,hes fine but im afraid we dont get a chance to see each other very much these days
0,how is gregor
0,oh thats such a delightful age
0,oh shes growing up very fast as a matter of fact shes six tomorrow
0,and your charming little daughter
0,yes its coming along very well
0,i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking
0,yes i think so just about then
0,fine
0,well shall we go through documentation
0,yes very pleasant
0,well did you have a pleaant flight
0,please it really doesnt matter
0,well thank you very much for being so understanding
0,im terribly sorry i was just on my way down to meet you i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time and i was on my way out of the office when suddenly the phone rang
0,how do you do mr miller
0,dr smyslov im not permitted to discuss this
0,this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts
0,quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius something apperently of an unknown origin is this in fact what has happened
0,certainly
0,dr floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question
0,well im glad about that
0,fortunately they did
0,yes well i hope the crew got back safely
0,yes and im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the ias convention
0,i see
0,thats right
0,you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
0,yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days
0,yes well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order
0,really
0,well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius
0,im sorry but im not sure i know what you mean
0,yesas a matter of fact i am
0,are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius
0,well as it happens im on my way up to the moon
0,yes really thank you very much
0,are you quite sure
0,oh i really dont have time for a drink if its all right ill just sit for a minute and then ive got to be off
0,i dont think it has but id like to check that simpson whats the log on that
0,has it been exposed to any sun before now
0,well not really at first glance black would suggest something sunpowered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device
0,any ideas about the colour
0,tomb shine surveymarker spare part take your choice
0,but you dont have any idea as to what it is
0,not really its completely inert no sound or energy sources have been detected the surface is made of something incredibly hard and weve been barely able to scratch it a laser drill
0,any clue as to what it is
0,by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill
0,how can you tell it was deliberately buried
0,yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago
0,im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement
0,dr floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps
0,well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable
0,no of course captain i can understand your concern
0,well fine thanks very much anyway and i hope you dont mind me asking
0,yes well i wouldnt have been too concerned about it except ive heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact ive heard that ten people have died already
0,i see well im sorry about that i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm
0,well ill tell you why i ask you see ive got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i havent been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears im a little concerned about her
0,i take it this is something to do with the trouble theyre having up at clavius
0,i see
0,well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twentyfour hours and then were going to back empty
0,what do you mean
0,incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements
0,thank you
0,oh no thank you the two girls have taken wonderful care of me im just fine
0,were scheduled to dock in about seven hours is there anything we can do for you
0,when do we arrive at clavius
0,theres nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest
0,oh marvellous its the first real sleep ive had for the past two days
0,all right hal well take care of it let me have the hard copy please
0,not really frank i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure
0,do you have any idea of what is causing this fault
0,let me see the tracking alignment display
0,i know you did frank but i assure you there was an impending failure
0,it looks like we have another bad ao unit my fpc shows another impending failure
0,yes hal whats up
0,opening pod bay doors
0,pod bay is decompressed all doors are secure you are free to open pod bay doors
0,hal check all airlock doors secure

0,so you took the rest of the night off
0,they must have set up a meeting for the morning luther left an 8 am wakeup and put up the dont disturb sign hes trading his girl for the money all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind

0,you know id be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way youve done with this job
0,yeah it doesnt look like hes gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy
0,a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row
0,if hes hoping that then hes dumber than i think he is which would be amazin cause i already think hes real dumb
0,maybe luther hopes ganzll give him a piece of your money
0,you got a very depressing view of life man you gotta smile once in awhile
0,im not in this cause its fun im not into hitting guys cause it makes me feel good either i do it cause it works
0,doesnt it get tiring
0,if they dont tell me what i need to know
0,say do you always work people over like you did luther
0,that aint philosophy thats common sense
0,i let women get to me the quest for pussy is the meaning of life i got my own personal philosophy about em keep women separate from guns money and business women are for spending money they got nothing to do with helping you make it
0,i suppose youd never be like luther and let a woman get to you
0,oh yeah does bein in love make you stupid
0,im tellin you the mans in love he wants to be a hero for his girl
0,if i was his size and had ganz on my ass id just leave town

0,i had no choice some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac
0,didnt know you darker people went in for foreign jobs
0,jesus christ look at all the dust on my carwhy in the hell dont he take it to a car wash

0,musta got some primo bondsman
0,what
0,guess what luther just got in line
0,not really i figured ganz was put down for a long time and i knew luther would never job me on his own hes too chickenshit
0,you took a big chance leaving this here all this time
0,shit
0,i wasnt sure the money was still there until we saw luther you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice jack
0,you son of a bitch you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing

0,i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers all those clowns ever had going for em was a gun and a badge
0,bullshit attitude and experience get you through
0,but you can handle it all right huh real amazin how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats

0,for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive
0,we do
0,i figured you share information

0,few days ago i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia a doctor and his wife what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81 which heads into philadelphia started up a conversation with this girl she looked homeless seemed about eighteen maybe they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city nice kid mature didnt have much to say but they got a sense shes a runaway so all through dinner the doctors working on her trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone not surprisingly she ate her food excused herself thats the last they saw her the reason they came to me for help the reason im coming to you is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch they want to see if i can id this girl somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kids alive doing alright
0,absolutely of course ill abide by whatever decision you make but id appreciate if youll hear me out

0,thats trust mr christian trusted me implicitly
0,so he sent you gave you the money his errandboy and if you refused it wasnt like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film thats the beauty of lawyerclient privilege
0,wouldnt exactly have been possible for a man of his stature
0,you were the middleman am i right old man christian wasnt about to go shopping for a snuff film himself
0,well whatever reasons mrs christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator i should certainly be a party to but since she feels differently i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval
0,thats right
0,you are a private investigator
0,of what sort
0,as mr christians attorney and one of the executors of his estate it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend
0,im listening
0,yes i do have something to say i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs christian contacted you
0,its not my money the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought lets not make a big deal out of this okay go be a race car driver go run for president whatever

0,how are you having any luck
0,mrs christian tom welles here
0,hello
0,youre one hell of a detective mrs christian
0,you told me to look so i looked
0,send it to me through the post office like we arranged no return address you dug this up all by yourself
0,okay
0,for a human life murder on film no statute of limitations who knows it sure could have id like you to overnight me a copy of those checks then put them in a safe deposit box
0,do you think the film could have cost that much
0,im here
0,hello
0,to the penny exactly one million dollars in cash
0,youre joking
0,totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
0,okay i follow you so far
0,one was for two hundred thousand one dollar and thirteen cents another was for three hundred thousand six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents
0,the checks were for odd amounts
0,im not positive this means anything
0,my husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash
0,okay
0,i know what im asking your compensation will be appropriate to the risk youll need cash to buy information and ill provide it i feel responsible mr welles you saw what he did to her
0,nothing remotely like this
0,youve found missing persons before
0,i deal in divorce cases corporate investigations
0,any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously ive thought about it and theres no other way if you cant find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well i cant let that happen im telling you i wont if theres no chance that poor girls memory can be served then ill just have to spend my last days trying to forget her
0,it wont work like that
0,no for me to live with the ruin of my husbands name i need know that whoever did this will be punished if you can find them i will take their names to the police ill say my husband confessed on his death bed ill say i didnt have courage to come forward at first
0,you dont have any other choice
0,i told you i cant not yet
0,you you need to go to the police
0,of course but im certain its nothing to worry about
0,will you watch it and see for yourself
0,im sure it is its probably something your husband was given as a bad joke more than likely he never even watched it
0,im telling you its not that
0,if you were to study it youd see the camera cutting away youd see the tricks they can play
0,no
1,please believe me this is probably a stag film simulated rape hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic fake blood and special effects
0,mrs christian please will you sit down a moment i want you to listen carefully what youre talking about is a snuff film but from what i know snuff films are a kind of urban myth like red light district folklore theres no such thing i can assure you
0,i didnt know what to think i cant tell you how horrible its been to know this belonged to my husband to know that he watched this this atrocity but i cant go to the police
0,this is a movie showing a girl being murdered shes sitting on a bed and a man rapes her and he begins to cut her with a knife i only watched what i could
0,im afraid i dont
0,its a film of a girl being murdered
0,cash stock certificates and this
0,do you want to tell me what you found
0,there was nothing he could do my husband left everything to me i prevented anyone from seeing the contents i felt these were my husbands private things i didnt i didnt realize
0,you hired someone to open it ill bet the lawyer loved that
0,my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe i knew about it but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business not till now that is
0,just curious
0,i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to other than that theres never any reason
0,do you carry a gun mr welles
0,we were married fortyfive years hard even for me to imagine we had our troubles there were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and i to him i loved him deeply
0,he succeeded
0,mostly thats where he started his empire building he was a good man notorious as an eccentric but that was something he cultivated he wanted to be legendary
0,pittsburgh
0,ill do whatever i can to help
0,his passing has left me with something of a dilemma a terrible terrible dilemma
0,my condolences
0,as you know my husband passed away recently two weeks ago now
0,you are highly recommended praised for your discretion your strict adherence to confidentiality
0,ive been privileged to provide services for people i admire
0,ive spoken to friends of mine and my husbands in harrisburg in lancaster and hershey asking about you i must say you have friends in influential places
0,hes a lawyer please sit here
0,hes odd
0,thank you
0,have a pleasant evening will you have tea mister welles
0,apparently mr longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak
0,uh huh pleasure
0,i try to be
0,mister welles youre very prompt
0,they murdered her mrs mathews im sorry it happened a month after she ran away shes been dead all this time
0,why why are you doing this to me
0,they killed her and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her
0,no no no
0,he raped her andandand he murdered herhe cut her up with knifes
0,no
0,they brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her
0,who are you
0,someone some men they took your daughter and they drugged her and they took her to a motel room they did terrible things to her
0,who is this
0,mrs mathews your daughter is dead shes dead
0,what
0,she went to california to los angeles she wanted to start over she wanted to be an actress
0,what are you talking about
0,i have to tell you something it wont be easy for you to hear its about your daughter mary anne when i when i was there with you her diary in your attic in silverware if you read it youll know what im telling you is true
0,i remember you just left
0,mrs mathews its thomas do you remember i was there a few weeks ago asking about your daughter
0,hello
0,what am i supposed to do forget her time heals all wounds right shes all i think about and ive learned to live with that but you want the truth the real truth if i had a choice if i had to choose between her being out there living a good life and being happy and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her or her being dead and me knowing id choose to know
0,its been six years
0,i think about it everyday but every time the phone rings every single time i still think its her
0,yes
0,you were right i didnt find anything im going to run and get something to eat are you hungry
0,youre probably right and i probably wont find anything i dont have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and theres a part of me that cant let it go police are just as human as you or i they could have missed something they probably didnt wouldnt you rather know
0,my husband never laid a hand on her she would have told me she would have told me
0,will you let me look
0,how how can you say that to me
0,if the police focused their search in her room her belongings well thatd be only natural but they may have been looking in the wrong place
0,no you dont have any reason to think that
0,it is possible and i know this isnt something you want to hear your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it she might have wanted to tell you something
0,i dont know i think so
0,do you think the police did a good job
0,there wasnt one the police looked
0,its not really my place but its not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either see i know a little about missing persons when kids run they almost always leave a note its guilt they want to say goodbye
0,what
0,ive got what i need for my report there is there is one thing that bothers me though
0,you should be
0,no
0,are you religious
0,were all like that
0,doesnt make much sense does it when everythings happy when lifes fine and you have every reason to believe theres a god you dont bother then something horrible happens thats when you start praying all the time thats when you start going to church
0,okay
0,i i shouldnt take anymore of your time maybe we can finish tomorrow ill call tomorrow
0,of course
0,people remember me from the news can you drive me back now
0,no one knows what its like you cant even imagine how much it hurts
0,i had to ask i apologize
0,you try going through what we did bob couldnt take it thats all christ theres times when it still seems like i cant either
0,i didnt mean to
0,there wasnt anything like that the police and the fbi people asked but there wasnt anything happened like that never my husband his heart broke when mary left
0,you have to forgive me but in these circumstances with your daughter were there any indications of any sort of abuse
0,it got to be too much for him
0,why do you think he did it
0,we were divorced by then things fell apart he was living with a friend
0,september 4th 1993 about a year after mary disappeared
0,yes
0,if theres anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but i have to ask your husband he committed suicide
0,i dont know
0,what was she running from
0,she didnt seem herself for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it one night we went to bed the next morning she was gone she took some clothes
0,she just seemed depressed
0,no
0,so she didnt leave a note she never gave any indication where she might go before she left
0,you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses want to know what its really like its sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wifes cheating on him glamorous huh and the guy who hired you he has a hairlip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wifes cheating and you dont blame her
0,i didnt think there were private detectives anymore except on tv
0,thats exactly what i am
0,they hired you youre like a private detective
0,its very important you dont let this raise your expectations its not going to effect any ongoing efforts all im saying is please know im not here to create any false hope

0,mark
0,why dont you shut up and let her talk two of us died in the last two days does that strike you as particularly normal
0,faint
0,vomit
0,two hours a day six days a week
0,dan and hes taking alice with him pretty good dive yvonne youve been practicing
0,and his egghead son well give em a uroughu ureceptionu wont we
0,i wouldnt worry so long as we have boats like the tiger shark and people like you the skipper dave kent sir ian and my father
0,i dont know
0,but if they udou
0,maybe just maybe when their ship doesnt return theyll decide not to come here after all
0,which is the one we have to worry about
0,yes
0,theyre so remote cold beautiful the stars but now i wonder
0,id sooner swim
0,however our ideas disagree as ive said before im unotu a coward and it happens youve got no choice either uiu take you down there in the lungfish or you dont get there
0,any more than being the son of captain neilsen does
0,thats enough holloway ive told you before wearing boards on your shoulders and parading with a stiff spine doesnt auto matically endow you with back bone
0,thenthis is a flying saucer
0,unidentified flying objects
0,you may not uwinu them but without men like your father to degrade himself by fighting to preserve them or as much as we have of them theyd have disappeared ulongu ago
0,peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit show me a man who says you win uthoseu by fighting wars and uillu show you an idiot
0,you mean unothingu is worth fighting for
0,perhaps but the idea of willingly going to uschoolu to spend my ulifeu at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunderlizards im referring to war uthatu strikes me as the uworstu cowardice of all being spiritually yellow
0,youre really a mixedup oddball arent you
0,that may be but dad stays where uheu is and im staying here
0,were uallu risking our lives
0,wearing a uniform doesnt bestow an automatic monopoly on courage ucommanderu it just so happens im unotu a coward physical or mental and before id risk my fathers life
0,uyouu said it but i wont argue
0,you trade school boys are all alike arent you anybody who doesnt happen to think like a little goldbraided puppet is ipso facto a coward
0,your father can be in nome alaska tomorrow we have two choices ask them to send him out in a copter and take you off or the shark can put back into nome
0,what did you mean im out
0,dead matter of fact hes much better hes left the hospital
0,my father hes not
0,your out this came for you
0,what is it
0,not in two days look do you think i uwantedu to come if it didnt mean so much to dad proving his depthexplorer its the last thing id want
0,you could train someone else
0,and they thought uyouu could re place the skipper
0,it was moderate hell be all right but it was out of the question his coming along
0,how is he
0,it was supposed to be dad had a heart attack two days ago
0,i should have suspectcd when i heard that doctor i thought it was your father
0,whats goin on in here lad what
0,dave
0,oh it does
0,here keep these it wants me to come alone
0,im with uyouu
0,well
0,well have to look for them later
0,wonder where powell and carney are
0,somewhere down there
0,where do you think the voice you heard was coming from
0,the sound again
0,you hear that
0,lets get back to work and maybe we uwillu be soon
0,and if i didnt uknowu better id swear we were moving
0,you know it uisu
0,hey you know somethin its getting lighter in here
0,strange you didnt hear it omit 274f
0,i dont hear anything maybe youve been down here too long why dont you go back up and
0,listen hear that
0,yeah
0,go back and tell dr neilsen have him report to the skipper
0,i think youre right
0,whats more important theres our problem the bow ram the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break if we can cut the ram the shark can pull herself loose
0,how about that the bow drove half through her but she sealed herself right up
0,not ualoneu youre not
0,you all wait here im going inside take a look
0,reef and i can take the explorer down clamp it around the eye and
0,us
0,youve got to let us try skipper
0,skipper look at the depth gauge
0,were stuck tight
0,sounds like it distress call from a small freighter between ellesmere island and greenland one mayday thennothing
0,cyclops
0,his side ive seen it all right a nice bright yellow
0,have you ever talked to carl tried to see his side
0,but utheyreu not skipper neilsens son it broke his heart then when some newspapers called carl the honest sincere son of a warmongering father captain neilsen resigned from the navy oh he still keeps his hand in playing around with projects like the lungfish but it broke him all the same
0,a lot of people think like that
0,so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school be gins making noises like a pacifist a real egghead dogooder and crackpot ban the atom tests junk the nuclear subs spend the mili tary budgetfor peace
0,so
0,one of the finest men and officers alive a real hero in the best sense of the word in world war two he taught us engineering and design fought like a demon to develop atom subs
0,i guess
0,i guess skipper neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the academy didnt he
0,i might have a son like uthatu
0,huh
0,youve asked why i stay a bachelor there goes the best reason i know
0,disappointing a ubigu girl
0,what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl
0,uthatsu the worst possible moment
0,at the worst possible moment tomorrow is janies birthday poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home now
0,so they caught up with you too
0,reef
0,helen i appeal to you
0,but julies a nice girl and ive seen you work she deserves a fighting chance
0,now dave old buddy you know youre exaggerating what do you think of this husband of yours on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer but unfortunately in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself
0,we hope
0,sidearms but the saucers dead
0,with their underwater experience theyll be invaluable take sidearms and flare pistols
0,the frogmen
0,you better take powell and carney with you
0,right at our oneeyed friend
0,what course skipper
0,what
0,a mass of jellylike stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo
0,speedabout twentytwo knots coursedue north
0,course and speed
0,idont know
0,what about down
0,seems to be all around
0,is there any way out of it
0,right skipper
0,get ready we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard
0,what
0,were dead in the water but it indicates were moving
0,why do you say that
0,the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash
0,something wrong
0,skipper could you take a look here
0,all internal repairs completed and frogmen report exterior damage minor
0,yes griff
0,excuse me skipper
0,what about time
0,its possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the pole
0,anything
0,excuse me captain there may be one last desperate chance a oneinathousand shot
0,radiation levelconstantly rising
0,now they feel itdown below
0,thats wonderful carl reef thinks they can clear the shark bow so we can pull ourself loose
0,wonderful
0,we read you go ahead doctor theyre inside the saucer its filled with breathable air
0,as ready as we ucanu be ill report to the skipper
0,all ready
0,there is i believe our friendcyclops is returning to life
0,theres got to be an explanation
0,as we near the pole
0,what direction does the system indicate
0,the radiation level from the saucer its rising
0,if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted
0,in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and as you put it recharging his batteries
0,the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all the earth itself
0,uweu harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force maybe cyclops does it on a usuperu scale
0,we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear but suppose it isnt at all what if its umagneticu
0,what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit perhaps be lying there waiting
0,suppose our theorizing is correct then this ucouldu be the next danger point
0,above murmansk and finland
0,highintensity arcs will burn submerged and millions of voltsdischarged in random directions
0,under uwateru
0,it doesnt seem possible but could it be an electrical storm center
0,minus three
0,whats the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole
0,nothing we can do now
0,straight to the pole at almost fifty knots
0,if we could get inside the saucer use our torches maybe we could cut the shark loose
0,what
0,suppose theres an atmosphere of some kind inside cyclops
0,and were at safe maximum depth already stop engines
0,its the screws skipper at our declination angle running in reverse theyre pulling the shark uandu cyclops right to the bottom
0,a hundred and eighty fathoms we cant be sinking that fast
0,we can uramu him
0,but what can we accomplish
0,thats what i said
0,right uatu him
0,thirtyfour seconds
0,whats the running time
0,take a look
0,youre sure its cyclops
0,after torpedo room report
0,determine extent of damage immediately
0,i think i should have joined the air force
0,what do you think
0,itll be all right were old friends
0,huh
0,doctor neilsen when did uthatu happen
0,dr neilsen hell be
0,who with
0,im afraid i have some bad news for you reef youll have to share quarters this trip
0,i met dr kent once
0,i did go just back reef these are a couple of our passengers sir ian hunt and dr clifford kent my exec commander richard holloway
0,thought you were going to washington skipper
0,uthatu might be a ulittleu uroughu
0,obviously
0,to navigate wont you have to see your way
0,of course but it is time to be gin the return voyage
0,thats why no water leaked inside when we rammed you
0,it is a living thing when damaged you would say wounded it immediately heals itself
0,i have selected you to return with me along with several other specimens for study we will examine you and the others discover desirable features to incorporate in our earthcolonizers
0,why
0,on the contrary i want you unharmed perfect
0,why not me what am i the closing act
0,i am afraid not therefore
0,he did
0,your friend was to remain where he was
0,swell
0,for horrors like yourself
0,my mission is to study various solar systems and planets select the most suitable for colonization
0,tell me something why can uiu hear you when the others couldnt
0,point of view is everything to us uyouru form of life is ugly as we appear to you
0,thats a ufaceu
0,come where
0,remove your weapons commander and come here alone
0,all right go to it
0,cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks
0,toward the pole
0,due north at five knotsno six
0,but uanswersu are what we need not more questions
0,weve asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times
0,or perhaps until he gets us
0,you plotted the course of cyclops then thats uouru course wherever uheu goes uweu gountil we get him
0,our cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself
0,just musing about our oneeyed adversary and the legend of homer cyclopes were the sons of heaven who forged the thunder bolts thrown by zeus
0,ill be another
0,well ill be
0,the pattern each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle
0,see what
0,thank you
0,my yeoman will show you to your quarters
0,all the figures show is that gordon lariviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as selectman in a year or two you wont recognize this town

0,ive been thinking about it thats all
0,oh wade
0,theres another thing ive been thinking about i dont know how you feel about the idea margie because weve never talked about it but ive been thinking lately ive been thinking we should get married sometime you and me
0,then i guess you have to
0,im her father supposed to be but im not able to yes yes i am it may be the only thing in my life ive been so clear about wanting even if it takes a big fight
0,dont you think do you still think its a good idea to press this custody thing just now

0,what way
0,yeah but never what you looked like not really never really studied your face like now i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now this way
0,you knew me as a kid

0,jack doesnt need money
0,money
0,wade how can you even think such a thing why would jack hewitt do that shoot twombley on purpose

0,what was that you got something to say say it say it
0,attago
0,just do it
0,a lesson in work and its rewards youll thank me for this one day sally turn off that tv
0,rolfe
0,take care of the little things first the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things call chub merritt get your car back call a dentist for gods sake and get your tooth pulled dont trust the locals get your facts straight and go straight to the state police let them work on this
0,to help jack of course and to nail those sonsofbitches the two gordons thats what alma calls them jesus rolfe whose side are you on
0,for what
0,i know what it means im just running out of ways to use it
0,but you gotta hear this you wont believe it mel gordon had come by to visit lariviere and so now im in his office
0,wade are you alright
0,then you accidentally see your body or your face or whatever and you dont know who the hell it belongs to strange its the business with the old man i know and how incredibly pissed i was at him and also chasing jack hewitt like that and the goddamned truck going through the ice not to mention margies being so upset one thing on top of another
0,thats what you think
0,i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop i was a careful child and i became a careful adult but at least i wasnt afflicted by that mans violence
0,well i never heard that one
0,and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft
0,wed have to go digging in vietnam to ask him
0,it wasnt me i wasnt there but i heard about it when i heard about it it was about elbourne
0,you think i wouldnt remember a thing like that
0,it may have happened but not the way you said
0,of course it happened why would i lie about it
0,i hate to disappoint you but i dont think it happened
0,yeah
0,i was thinking about that story you told me about pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after
0,i care about what happened the truth im a student of history remember
0,rights right goddamnit dont you care whats right
0,not particularly
0,its too neat things aint that neat it makes me mad that somebody can pay to kill somebody his own fatherinlaw and not be punished for it dont that piss you off
0,shit around here you shoot somebody in the woods you say it was an accident you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted jacks probably saying the guy shot himself cause he aint got his deer yet and dont want his license pulled
0,a hunting accident is perfect
0,so mel gordon wouldnt want a professional hit thatd make the feds dig deeper he wants an accident
0,heres my theory twombley unaware of illegal union loans or whatever starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out finds out his soninlaw is involved
0,yeah the guy with the bmw i told you about i did didnt i
0,okay its likely there are people in the union who dont want twombley to testify they probably include his soninlaw whos vicepresident and will probably be the next president i read that in the papers whats his name mel gordon
0,i dont know you tell me
0,they wouldnt deal with a guy like jack who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead
0,whod pay him that kind of money not the mob they got their own guys specialists
0,money
0,motive you gotta have a motive
0,well your friend i think jack hewitt
0,then who shot him
0,that it wasnt an accident
0,which is
0,i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one
0,find them everywhere
0,want to know what i think happened
0,i guess it was an accident like everybody thinks
0,anything new about the shooting twombley
0,i want to let the gas run out i dont want the bastard driving drunk and hes always drunk now after well hide the keys
0,yeah shell probably quit her job and stay out here with pop we cant leave him alone here hell set the damn place on fire with jill here a lot itll be good to have margie around things are going to change in that department by the way i got a custody lawyer in concord im gonna see him tomorrow all hells gonna break loose but its worth it
0,well do you still plan to get married
0,what about her
0,what about margie
0,yeah i forgot
0,no thanks i dont drink
0,anyone else want one rolfe
0,what about jill is lillian bringing her
0,pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do i guess
0,no no i havent not really ive growled a little but i havent bit
0,havent you already done a bit of that
0,i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days rolfe and some night im going to bite back i swear it

0,the chief justice what on earth for
0,if fired upon tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage
0,iraqis wont buy it either theyre already in on this or theyll think were spying

0,they still have the president its past their deadline and they havent called what do you think it means
0,okay also i want you to put our bases in turkey on alert and have the kitty hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike

0,up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the mission communication center the mcc as we call it can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth were linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations we could run the country or run a war from there if we had to

0,if the drug is here we must destroy it
0,okay george we gotta play this real smart
0,harcourt was the brain who brought it all together
0,they had months in quarantine to develop the plan porter with his chemistry background must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug hubley manufactured it at the refinery strader through the nightclub established a distribution network and harcourt
0,i must trust you matthew i cannot stop this without you
0,george look me in the eye george you dont ever lie to me again

0,whats this nothing shit it wasnt nothing yesterday when you asked bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits and its not nothing now dont lie to me george youre bad at it
0,and porter ran a piece of shit momandpop minimart so what the hells the connection
0,warren hubley was in middle management at a refinery joshua strader operated a successful bar and nightclub

0,yeah sure i knew that
0,if i may make a suggestion we have different weak spots than you do next time a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm here will produce the effect i think you were looking for
0,in the camps we were lodged four to a room the selection process was entirely random we did not get to stay with our friends or families
0,how could a straightarrow like you ever pick a roommate like him
0,from quarantine when my people first arrived here he and i were housed together
0,you know that guy

0,at the end of the bar
0,who said that
0,my partner is dead because one of you bastards killed him then disappeared into a rathole down in slagtown where hes home and dry cause nobody sees nothing nobody says nothing
0,agree to work with me you dont like me you dont like any of us you have nothing but contempt for us and yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner
0,whyd i do what
0,why did you do it
0,wed like to ask you about a business associate of your warren hubley
0,rudyard kipling no shit listen we just need a minute of your time
0,he has not been home since that day but she told me where to find him
0,did you talk to him
0,she didnt know him but she said her son might
0,awright what about the other guy
0,a week ago two men came to see her husband after they left he was very frightened she identified one of the men from a photo i showed her it was hubley
0,did you learn anything
0,mrs porter is not taking her husbands death well
0,why the hell great fine you talk to the wife
0,i believe i should interview the widow alone
0,so the slag theyre cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like hubley worked at a refinery id say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible okay next step i gotta go talk to the wife of the slag store owner blown away last night
0,a large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us my spouses brother is one
0,how the hell do you know that
0,newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks
0,and still it fits
0,well yeah its rubber it stretches

0,nothing
0,nothing
0,whats this whats going on
0,great well im sure glad thats settled arent you
0,yes no it is not unreasonable although i
0,possibly good well would you be willing to accept the theory george that possibly by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other does that sound unreasonable to you
0,well yes quite possibly
0,nothings wrong i just want to get something straight you agree that theres a good chance these two shootings are somehow related right
0,what is wrong
0,well theres a thing about partners about being somebodys partner you do for each other and other peoples rules dont mean shit its the rules set up between the two of you thats all that counts understand okay well my friend and partner was shot last night and im after the shitbag that did it as my partner im asking you to respect me and help me find him

0,there was no wallet but he was still wearing a watch and two rings
0,terrific a real pillar of the community was hubley missing anything when they found him was he ripped off
0,nice signal dickwad
0,through the chest rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts
0,with two bri sabot slugs in the chest
0,his body was discovered three days ago in an alley off of central avenue near downtown

0,how much time
0,see you soon
0,its going to be closer you better get going
0,all right lets get on it whatll you need
0,im really the only one qualified to remotepilot the ship anyway believe me id prefer not to i may be synthetic but im not stupid
0,what
0,ill go
0,im afraid so the crash did too much damage the overload is inevitable at this point
0,and its too late to shut it down
0,im projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours the blast radius will be about thirty kilometers about equal to ten megatons
0,how long until it blows
0,thats it see it emergency venting
0,hard to say it may have been blind instinctattraction to the heat of whateverbut she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldnt destroy her without destroying ourselves thats if she exists of course
0,could it be intelligent
0,well the queen is always physically larger then the others a termite queens abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it cant move at all it is fed and tended by drone workers defended by the warriors she is the center of their lives quite literally the mother of their society
0,youre saying one of those things lays all the eggs
0,that is the question of the hour we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization an ant of termite colony for example is ruled by a single female a queen which is the source of new eggs
0,but these things come from eggsso where are all the eggs coming from
0,yes that follows
0,which would mean lots of those parasites right one for each personover a hundred at least
0,now let me get this straight the aliens paralyzed the colonists carried them over there cocooned them to be hosts for more of those
0,ive isolated a neuromuscular toxin responsible for the paralysis it seems to be metabolizing he should wake up soon
0,sorry to disappoint you
0,i expected more of you ripley i thought you would be smarter than this
0,look maybe the thing didnt even exist right and if id made it a major security situation the administration wouldve stepped in then no exclusive rights nothing
0,you sent them out there and you didnt even warn them burke why didnt you warn them
0,you sent them to that ship i just checked the colony log directive dates sixtwelveseventynine signed burke carter j
0,now wait a second
0,but they will know about it burke from me just like theyll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fiftyseven colonists here
0,youve been doing your homework look they cant impound it if they dont know about it
0,you just try getting a dangerous organism past icc quarantine section 22350 of the commerce code
0,those specimens are worth millions to the bioweapons division now if youre smart we can both come out of this heroes set up for life
0,this operation is under military jurisdiction and hicks is next in chain of command right
0,corporal hicks
0,what rank i believe corporal hicks has authority here
0,dont make me pull rank ripley
0,you son of a bitch
0,bullshit
0,this is clearly an important species were dealing with here we cant just arbitrarily exterminate them
0,they can bill me i got a tab running whats second
0,well i meani know this is an emotional moment but lets not make snap judgments lets move cautiously first this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it
0,why not
0,now hold on a second im not authorizing that action
0,no good how do we know itll effect their biochemistry i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit its the only way to be sure
0,shes right
0,thats not what i mean gorman if your men have to use their weapons in there theyll rupture the cooling system
0,yeah maybe the organisms like the heat thats why they built
0,theyre right under the primary heat exchangers
0,uhhunh one of thirty or so all over the planet theyre completely automated we manufacture them by the way
0,that the atmosphere processor
0,i suggest you study the disks ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you
0,i hope youre right i really do
0,well it didnt occur to me its been policy for years to have a synthetic on board
0,you never said anything about an android being here why not
0,thats the plan my word on it
0,burke just tell me one thing that youre going out there to kill them not study not bring back just burn them outclean forever
0,yello oh ripley hi
0,no the answer is no now please go im sorry just go would you
0,yes and ive read it you wake up every night sheets soaking the same nightmare over and over

0,people who know say the girls got talent you must judge for yourself if you think she stinks say so
0,its such an honour for us to have you here herr mozart and for gertrude
0,gertrude
0,ive heard about you for ages i thought you must be an old man
0,you cant be herr mozart
0,gertrude
0,upstairs
0,thank you madame come on now courage play me something you know
0,i was but she quite outgrew the little i could show her
0,who was your teacher
0,just one year
0,wine
0,id like a little wine if you have it
0,perhaps a little refreshment first a little coffee or a little chocolate
0,ah now here she comes
0,really
0,well look at them
0,it is not a question of liking your majesty your own law decrees it im afraid
0,do you like this salieri
0,molested majesty twice in the course of the same lesson
0,yes
0,as a matter of fact one of my own pupils a very young singer told me she was er well
0,really
0,i have to tell you mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies
0,of course not
0,majesty i dont like to talk against a fellow musician
0,oh
0,well sire i made some inquiries in a routine way i was curious to know why he had so few pupils it is rather alarming
0,why not
0,majesty i did believe me it was a most agonizing decision but finally i simply could not recommend herr mozart
0,i dont think you understand me court composer
0,well there it is
0,sire
0,you please me court composer a very clever idea
0,im sure there is a way majesty some kind of a little contest i could perhaps put together a small committee and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majestys wishes
0,ahha favouritism but i so want mozart
0,yes of course my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism
0,and the result satisfies
0,you already commissioned an opera from mozart
0,yes
0,an interesting idea majesty but
0,im thinking about herr mozart what is your view
0,oh your majesty it would be such a tremendous honour
0,your highness
0,good morning court composer this is my niece the princess elizabeth
0,cattivo again court composer well tell him mozart name us a german virtue
0,excuse me sire but what do you think these could be being a foreigner i would love to learn
0,well im glad to hear that
0,well there it is now to business young man we are going to commission an opera from you what do you say
0,my pleasure
0,finally such an immense joy diletto straordinario
0,and here is our illustrious court composer herr salieri
0,ahha
0,aflat majesty
0,lets have some fun bring in herr mozart please but slowly slowly i need a minute to practice
0,you do me too much honour sire
0,delightful court composer would you permit me to play it as he comes in
0,majesty
0,may i try it
0,its just a trifle of course
0,what a charming idea may i see
0,you are cattivo court composer i want to meet this young man chamberlain arrange a pleasant welcome for him
0,i think it is an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna majesty it should really infuriate the archbishop beyond measure if that is your majestys intention
0,sire the whole opera is finished do you know how much work went into it
0,you are passionate mozart but you do not persuade
0,forgive me majesty im a vulgar man but i assure you my music is not
0,twenty sire how about twenty twenty minutes of continuous music no recitatives
0,well six or seven minutes maybe eight
0,guess guess majesty imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it
0,i have no idea
0,but its new its entirely new its so new people will go mad for it for example i have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet just a man and wife quarreling suddenly the wifes scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation duet turns into trio then the husbands equally screaming valet comes in trio turns into quartet then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet and so on on and on sextet septet octet how long do you think i can sustain that
0,ah love again
0,but majesty this is just a frolic its a piece about love
0,i think you are rather innocent my friend in these dangerous times i cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece
0,sire i swear to your majesty theres nothing like that in the story i have taken out everything that could give offense i hate politics
0,mozart i am a tolerant man i do not censor things lightly when i do i have good reason figaro is a bad play it stirs up hatred between the classes in france it has caused nothing but bitterness my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people i do not wish to see the same fears starting here
0,well majesty it is only a comedy
0,would you tell me why
0,well yes i admit it is
0,it is not your place to ask questions is it true
0,who told you this majesty
0,yet we hear you are making an opera from it is this true
0,yes sire
0,mozart are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre
0,ah by all means
0,may i introduce my father he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg he would so much like to kiss your hand it would make his whole stay so memorable for him
0,what is it
0,majesty may i ask you to do me the greatest favour
0,thank you sire
0,bravo mozart most charming yes indeed clever man
0,well my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in vienna
0,twentysix
0,excuse me but how old are you
0,well well we havent quite received my fathers consent your majesty not entirely not altogether
0,really how delightful may i ask when you marry
0,enchanted madame
0,majesty this is madame weber she is my landlady
0,which few did you have in mind majesty
0,my dear young man dont take it too hard your work is ingenious its quality work and there are simply too many notes thats all cut a few and it will be perfect
0,my dear fellow there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening i think im right in saying that arent i court composer
0,i dont understand there are just as many notes majesty as are required neither more nor less
0,well i mean occasionally it seems to have how shall one say how shall one say director
0,what do you mean sire
0,of course i do its very good of course now and then just now and then it gets a touch elaborate
0,so then you like it you really like it your majesty
0,oh yes absolutely german unquestionably
0,and german
0,yes indeed
0,it is new it is isnt it sire
0,i think so sire yes
0,what on one hearing only
0,keep it sire if you want to it is already here in my head
0,ahha
0,in a pashas harem majesty a seraglio
0,yes where
0,its actually quite amusing majesty its set the whole thing is set in a in a
0,well what is it about tell us the story
0,because ive already found the most wonderful libretto
0,why so
0,did we vote in the end for german or italian
0,majesty
0,really oh grazie signore sono commosso e un onore per mo eccezionale compositore brilliante e famossissimo
0,and now he has returned the compliment herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you
0,oh sir yes the honour is mine absolutely
0,the director of our opera count orsinirosenberg
0,oh thank you
0,no no please it is not a holy relic you know we have met already in this very room perhaps you wont remember it you were only six years old he was giving the most brilliant little concert here as he got off the stool he slipped and fell my sister antoinette helped him up herself and do you know what he did jumped straight into her arms and said will you marry me yes or no
0,your majesty
0,ahha well there it is good
0,hes here
0,yes what about him
0,your majesty herr mozart
0,well what do you have for me today
0,well there it is
0,yes sir
0,in my opinion it is time we had a piece in our own language sir plain german for plain people
0,ahha what do you say chamberlain
0,very small pay i imagine im sure he could be tempted with the right offer say an opera in german for our national theatre
0,i agree majesty but im afraid its not possible the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop
0,ahha well then we should make some effort to acquire him we could use a good german composer in vienna surely
0,hush im talking to his majesty your majesty i wish to express only one thing that you who are the father of us all could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers it is not for nothing that the fifth commandment tells us honour your father and mother that your days may be long upon the earth
0,father
0,she does she says i sleep all day
0,no one calls you that
0,dont worry im not staying here to be a burden

0,i know i know perhaps you should give me some lessons in that
0,i think you overestimate our dear viennese my friend do you know you didnt even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap
0,its the best opera yet written i know it why didnt they come
0,i think its marvelous truly
0,what did you think of it yourself did you like it at all
0,well i can speak for the emperor you made too many demands on the royal ear the poor man cant concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four
0,but what is it they dont like
0,i know its outrageous still if the public doesnt like ones work one has to accept the fact gracefully
0,nine performances nine thats all its had and withdrawn
0,thank you oh thank you
0,with all my heart mozart
0,oh excellency would you
0,but there are those who have power over him i think ill take this up with the emperor
0,its not fair that a man like that has power over our work
0,how fortunate
0,oh no my wife took it out in time
0,you burned the score
0,oh i could kill him i mean really kill him i actually threw the entire opera on the fire he made me so angry
0,why bother with orsinirosenberg hes obviously no friend of yours
0,i dont know they say ive got to rewrite the opera but its perfect as it is i cant rewrite whats perfect cant you talk to him
0,really why
0,its unbelievable the director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music pages of it
0,wolfgang what is it sta calmo per favore whats the matter

0,two thousand two hundred florins is all i need a hundred fifty

0,im afraid not
0,do you have a daughter

0,an implausible idea between you and me no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess elizabeth
0,but i cant lose this post i simply cant excellency please lets go to the palace and you can explain to the emperor that herr sommer is an awful choice he could actually do musical harm to the princess
0,no no no he has yet to achieve mediocrity

0,your excellency you requested some specimens of my work here they are i dont have to tell you how much i need your help i truly appreciate your looking at these i have pressures on me financial pressures as you know im a married man now
0,herr mozart what brings you here
0,it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today dont you agree
0,how could i not
0,did you like it then
0,dear mozart my sincere congratulations
0,but this is absurd
0,yes yes er on the whole yes majesty
0,ah love well of course in italy we know nothing about that
0,love sire
0,a funny little tune but it yielded some good things
0,ah
0,mio caro adone
0,really
0,i know your work well signore do you know i actually composed some variations on a melody of yours
0,oh yes certainly certainly herr director
0,can we see the scene with the music back please
0,taking out what you should never have put in
0,what are you doing herr director
0,it is dangerous for you to interpret his majestys edicts give me your score please
0,but surely the emperor didnt mean to prohibit dancing when its part of the story
0,exactly a dance
0,yes but this is not a ballet this is a dance at figaros wedding
0,did you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas
0,certainly herr director
0,mozart herr mozart may i have a word with you please right away
0,just let me tell you how it begins
0,that will do herr mozart
0,but your majesty
0,what you think mozart is scarcely the point it is what his majesty thinks that counts
0,well not especially it can be in turkish if you really want i dont care
0,then why especially does it have to be in german
0,exactly
0,you mean in turkey
0,i think youd better
0,i i dont think you have herr director not yet i mean its quite n of course ill show it to you immediately
0,oh have i seen it
0,may i just do that majesty show you how it begins just that
0,herr mozart
0,must i well i wont i tell you straight i will not
0,look young man the issue is simple if you want this post you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues
0,show them one interesting modulation and they faint ohime morbidezza morbidezza italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music
0,mozart
0,they hate my music it terrifies them the only sound italians understand is banality tonic and dominant tonic and dominant from here to resurrection baba baba baba baba anything else is morbid
0,mozart
0,naturally the italians of course always the italians
0,kapellmeister bonno count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri
0,who is on this committee
0,a little modesty would suit you better
0,no but im the best
0,mozart you are not the only composer in vienna
0,then why doesnt he simply appoint me to the post
0,on the contrary
0,is the emperor angry with me
0,because his majesty wishes it
0,why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee just to teach a sixteenyearold girl
0,what is what
0,what is this herr chamberlain
0,because they do they go on forever at least what they represent the eternal in us not the ephemeral opera is here to ennoble us you and me just as much as his majesty
0,elevated what does that mean elevated the only thing a man should elevate is oh excuse me im sorry im stupid but i am fed up to the teeth with elevated things old dead legends how can we go on forever writing about gods and legends
0,mozart music is not the issue here no one doubts your talent it is your judgment of literature thats in question even with the politics taken out this thing would still remain a vulgar farce why waste your spirit on such rubbish surely you can choose more elevated themes
0,sire only opera can do this in a play if more than one person speaks at the same time its just noise no one can understand a word but with music with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once and its not noise its a perfect harmony isnt that marvelous
0,mozart
0,baron
0,well done mozart really quite fine
0,why not its charming i mean i dont actually show concubines exposing their their its not indecent its highly moral majesty its full of proper german virtues i swear it absolutely
0,my dear fellow the language is not finally the point do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre
0,oh german german please let it be german
0,i dont think it was really decided director
0,dont pity me pity yourself you serve a wicked god he killed mozart not i took him snatched him away without pity he destroyed his beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory he doesnt care understand that god cares nothing for the man he denies and nothing either for the man he uses he broke mozart in half when hed finished with him and threw him away like an old worn out flute
0,oh my son my poor son
0,no father from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me whenever they say mozart with love theyll have to say salieri with loathing and thats my immortality at last our names will be tied together for eternity his in fame and mine in infamy at least its better than the total oblivion hed planned for me your merciful god
0,my son why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer is that your penance is it
0,what difference does that make
0,but not his body
0,i poisoned his life
0,no you didnt
0,i did
0,why why why why add to your misery by confessing to murder you didnt kill him
0,the only thing that worried me was the actual killing how does one do that how does one kill a man its one thing to dream about it its very different when you have to do it with your own hands
0,yes
0,his funeral imagine it the cathedral all vienna sitting there his coffin mozarts little coffin in the middle and suddenly in that silence music a divine music bursts out over them all a great mass of death requiem mass for wolfgang mozart composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri what sublimity what depth what passion in the music salieri has been touched by god at last and god forced to listen powerless powerless to stop it i at the end for once laughing at him do you understand do you
0,what
0,oh yes yes yes yes yes always the same stale answers there is no god of mercy father just a god of torture
0,i do not claim to unravel the mysteries i treasure them as you should
0,oh i thought you did so every day so speak now answer me
0,my son no one can speak for god
0,all i ever wanted was to sing to him thats his doing isnt it he gave me that longing then made me mute why tell me that if he didnt want me to serve him with music why implant the desire like a lust in my body then deny me the talent go on tell me speak for him
0,gods ways are not yours and you are not here to question him offer him the salt of penitence he will give you back the bread of eternal life he is all merciful that is all you need to know
0,no was mozart a good man
0,you cannot say that
0,yes father yes so much for my vow of chastity what did it matter good patient hardworking chaste what did it matter had goodness made me a good composer i realized it absolutely then that moment goodness is nothing in the furnace of art and i was nothing to god
0,every day sometimes for hours i would pray
0,did you try
0,it was incomprehensible what was god up to here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve gods gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions even though engaged to be married and no rebuke at all was it possible i was being tested was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense no matter how painful that was very possible all the same why him why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts i couldnt stop them
0,he was murdered father mozart cruelly murdered
0,do you hear me
0,should i
0,do you believe it
0,is it true
0,and do they believe it
0,all vienna has heard that
0,ah youve heard that
0,of course the man you accuse yourself of killing
0,i didnt that was mozart wolfgang amadeus mozart you know who that is
0,oh i know that thats charming i didnt know you wrote that
0,can you recall no melody of mine i was the most famous composer in europe when you were still a boy i wrote forty operas alone what about this little thing
0,i regret it is not too familiar
0,well
0,im surprised you dont know it was a very popular tune in its day i wrote it how about this
0,i cant say i do what is it
0,then you must know this
0,here in vienna
0,where
0,i know a little i studied it in my youth
0,how well are you trained in music
0,my son there is something dreadful on your soul unburden it to me im here only for you please talk to me
0,i do not seek forgiveness
0,offer me your confession i can offer you gods forgiveness
0,are they
0,that makes no difference all men are equal in gods eyes
0,do you know who i am you never heard of me did you
0,i cannot leave alone a soul in pain
0,leave me alone
0,do you understand that you have sinned gravely
0,what do you want
0,in the sight of god that is a sin
0,so
0,you tried to take your life you do remember that dont you
0,about what
0,i am father vogler i am a chaplain here i thought you might like to talk to someone
0,what do you want
0,yes in the third act
0,yes absolutely is there a ballet in figaro
0,excuse me didnt his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera
0,ballet what ballet
0,about the ballet
0,what anger
0,the emperor has given him permission
0,incredible
0,well mozart is already rehearsing
0,never mind
0,where
0,ive seen the manuscript
0,are you absolutely sure
0,you must be mad
0,yes
0,hes setting that play to music
0,exactly
0,you mean that play
0,italian
0,mozart is writing a new opera an italian opera
0,yes
0,ive just learned something that might be of interest to you herr director
0,ah
0,well the play makes a hero out of a valet he outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher do you see the implications this would be in a grander situation as if a chamberlain were to expose an emperor
0,oh yes yes and that was
0,for the same reason herr chamberlain that it was banned in france
0,i know we banned this play but frankly i cant remember why can you refresh my memory herr director
0,did we
0,well actually sire if you remember we did finally incline to italian
0,well done sire
0,bravo your majesty
0,oh im tender enough for you my boy im tender enough for you
0,well i dont know i mean youre a delicious delightful delectable little bird but dont you think you might be just a little tough
0,of course now right away before i get any older
0,what do you mean now
0,well promise then
0,i cant wait
0,now youve got to promise me faithfully youll remain true to me forever then youll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you
0,oh well thank you how wonderful some people get all the luck
0,ive taken pity on you my angel i heard your wish
0,what who the devil are you
0,here i am my angel
0,indeed just a moment as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him a very appropriate person to do so yes
0,how sad its tragic isnt it such a talent
0,no baron no im afraid mozart is a lost cause he has managed to alienate practically the whole of vienna he is constantly drunk he never pays his debts i cant think of one person to whom i dare recommend him
0,cant you think of anyone who might commission some work from him ive done my best i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts he got a fee what i could afford cant you think of anyone who might do something for him
0,i agree baron
0,this is embarrassing you know you introduced mozart to some of my friends and hes begging from practically all of them it has to stop
0,come with me and stay in the room
0,he didnt say sir i told him i didnt know when you would be back but he insisted on waiting
0,what does he want
0,show her in then go to bed
0,that lady is back sir
0,excuse me my dear
0,she didnt say but she says its urgent
0,who is she
0,excuse me sir there is a lady who insists on talking to you
0,yes indeed goodnight to you all now it was perfection truly

0,yes doctor
0,right now listen carefully i want you to bring david here i want him in my care ill notify the police that weve found him it is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital do you understand
0,yes i should think so
0,could you get here without any trouble
0,no not really
0,is david acting strangely
0,no why
0,have you read the papers today have you listened to the radio or television
0,yes he is hes very excited and confused but hes not crazy if thats what you mean
0,the zoo is he rational
0,he doesnt remember he woke up at the zoo
0,is he all right why didnt you call me where was he
0,hes here
0,lets call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy
0,what shall we do
0,oh i dont mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon but in such a deranged state he could harm himself or perhaps others
0,dr hirsch
0,david has suffered a severe trauma i myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in east proctor if all the villagers believe that jack goodman was killed by a werewolf why shouldnt david and then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf wouldnt he himself become a werewolf the next full moon
0,surely youre not suggesting
0,no he knows no one in london besides me i shouldnt have left him alone
0,youve absolutely no idea where david might be
0,i think the village of east proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret im convinced that like david they believe in this werewolf
0,and what else
0,they were lying there were no witnesses no escaped lunatic the whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there
0,yes
0,i tried to investigate the attack there are no records the case was closed and now theyve misplaced the file davids lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before i did the goodman boy is already in the ground so hes no good to us so i went to the pub in east proctor where i was convinced of two things
0,dr hirsch whats wrong is this more serious than i know
0,warn him
0,david says jack comes to warn him
0,what did he say
0,yes
0,has his friend appeared to him again
0,well yes but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend
0,alex has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies

0,thats a wolfs head
0,of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol
0,the slaughtered lamb
0,she says she likes me too much
0,weve known debbie what since the eighth grade how many years of foreplay is that
0,it is impossible for a body like that to be dull
0,it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull
0,i have to make love to her its very simple she has no choice really
0,if you dont stop im going to kill you
1,rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein the love affair that shocked europe see torrid lovemaking at its most explicit see jack and debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the vatican never has the screen dared
0,i dont know
0,well anyway do you think shell be there
1,im talking about a girl you want to fuck so give me a break
0,youre talking about the woman i love
0,shes a jerk
0,debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time
0,i think debbie klein is a mediocre person with a good body
0,do you think shell meet me in rome
0,right
0,im sorry northern england first italy later
0,well i like it here

0,yes
0,are you cold
0,stay here if we need you well know where to reach you
0,what can we do to assist you
0,regardless of what you think lieutenant the fact remains that david is missing and that we must find him
0,the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved thats true but i hardly think
0,why dont we ask him
0,has david kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors
0,you were saying
0,well then what can i do for scotland yard
0,no thank you doctor
0,come in come in please sit some tea
0,dr hirsch
0,tell him im out no tell him ive passed away an old war wound or something tell him im dead and no more calls
0,hes on the telephone
0,what here
0,roger mathison doctor
0,excuse me yes
0,send them in
0,lt villiers and sgt mcmanus are here to see you doctor
0,yes
0,i see youve heard nothing about the incident
0,oh thats been there for two hundred years we were going to paint it out but its traditional so we left it

0,do you have any hot soup
0,well find him not to worry
0,i cannot accept a connection between david kessler and last nights murders we will find him however i can assure you of that
0,that is precisely my point david as far as we are concerned the matter is closed we wont trouble you any further good day
0,i dont rightly know sir
0,and what sergeant
0,lieutenant the boy seems pretty lucid to me and
0,sgt mcmanus are you suggesting that david and jack were in fact attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of east proctor has conspired to keep it a secret we have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police we have two witnesses to the crime youll forgive me mr kessler if i consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock
0,he may have a point lieutenant two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man
0,has mr kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors
0,sorry
0,id like some tea please
0,no thank you
0,yeah sure
0,yes sure

0,not yet mr clark
0,mr dickson in yet
0,all right let him im sick and tired of hearing about him if he wants to run the bank let him do it i dont want any part of it
0,you know dickson as well as we do hell shut the doors before he gives up control
0,take it easy clark
0,how are you protecting your depositors by making a lot of idiotic loans
0,what good will that do why it will take control away from him well put somebody else in charge call in all doubtful loans and be on safe ground again thats what good it will do
0,what good will that do
0,dickson doesnt have to go but he must agree to this merger with new york trust
0,dont make me laugh schultz
0,oh is he we carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city were fools to tolerate it
0,personally i think youre getting panicstricken about nothing dicksons all right
0,you know what you can do with that come on take a look at this youll see a demonstration of faith thats worth more than all the collateral in the world
0,weve been waiting fifteen minutes
0,come out here you pawnbrokers take a look at this
0,the bank all right do anything you want with it
0,dickson id like to talk to you about the bank
0,i cant you just wait and see if that run doesnt stop within the next hour ill shut the doors you know what that means the bank examiner will step in tomorrow youll be forced to liquidate ill insist upon it the depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar whats left you gentlemen can have but ill guarantee there wont be enough to pay your next months garage bill
0,say you cant do that
0,so thats it eh youve waited a long time for this chance havent you well im not going to resign now or ever
0,no you cant reason with anyone else when youre in a jam we pleaded with you to keep liquid but you wouldnt listen to us you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish now you want our help you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that youve wrecked all right theres one way you can get it give us an option on your stock and resign as president
0,aw theyve gone crazy you cant reason with a mob
0,the depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you you thought they were your friends why dont you go out there now and try and get some help from them
0,i have everything i own in it its your bank as well as mine isnt it
0,that sounds very simple dickson but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes
0,i know that among you you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city get that money over here and ill stop this run within five minutes
0,what do you mean help
0,well be forced to shut the doors ive worked twentyfive years night and day to keep this bank alive youve all made money out of it are you willing to help
0,well discuss that in the board room
0,what about
0,we want to talk to you
0,yes you said it clark thats the only thing that means anything to me
0,gentlemen you notice mr dickson refuses to consider our wishes he refuses an offer to merge with the new york trust the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground he insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as as faith
0,im running this bank my way get that clear
0,i know dickson thats all very well but youre taking too many chances in these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble in case of emergency
0,most of the creditors i know personally ive seen them grow up in the community i knew their fathers and mothers before them
0,not at all thats alexander hamiltons idea5 the finest banking mind this country has ever known those are his exact words gentlemen character its the only thing you can bank on and its the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums
0,character hmmpf thats your idea
0,just pure luck
0,whats the matter with my policy how many losses has this bank taken in the last twentyfive years ill tell you not a single one whats wrong with that kind of banking
0,oh you would eh all right if its more important than golf go ahead whats on your mind
0,i think mr dickson we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning if you dont mind
0,say you know i found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball youve got to hit with the left hand and from the inside out its the only way you can hit anything
0,he wont believe it mr dickson but its the truth honest it is i was in my apartment last night ask your wife she
0,claims he was there with a married woman doesnt want to mention her name
0,i didnt kill him i had nothing to do with that i tell you i was home in my apartment last night i can prove it
0,dont forget theres a dead watchman downstairs
0,i was crazy i tell you mr dickson i didnt know what i was doing i wandered around in a daze all i could think of was that they were going to kill me youll stand by me wont you mr dickson you wont go back on me now will you ill die if they send me to prison

0,heard of him
0,you know him
0,your zee hmm from womens eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world

0,i swear ill shoot you in your sleep
0,you are a charmer
0,you can shut up now
0,big and older
0,maybe maybe
0,that just might work
0,what kind of story are they going to believe
0,think about this if we just come up with a story and stick to it we should be all right
0,all we thought about was coming home i swore id kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again if i have to go to war with the railroad to stay fine by me
0,saved all our lives doc none of the liberty boys would have come home if not for web mimms doc gods honest truth
0,whyyyy he took down the gatling gun and the cannon all by himself
0,zee we got to talk to you and your father
0,youre doing just fine
0,frank dont you have something to say

0,looks like web mimms wasnt the only casualty this towns got
0,all this time in the saddle we get to the farm im going to shoot this damn horse just on principle
0,hello liberty missoura
0,im sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
0,hell of a war
0,i reckoned
0,webs dead
0,no jesse your problem is youre always doing stuff before im finished figuring it out
0,see thats your problem frank by the time you finish figuring out stuff im already finished doing it

0,such as
0,mmhmm
0,so youre saying i could have done more to attract their attention
0,pff they hardly even noticed you
0,distracting enough for you
0,so we got a plan
0,every time i put my head up to hit that gatling they try to shoot it off
0,everything but the boring parts
0,how much of that story is true
0,yeah jimmy
0,uncle frank
0,i think he was just a real interestin fella to have around
0,so what was he
0,cant argue that
0,but he killed a lot of men too
0,saved a lot of folk from the railroad
0,theyre making him a hero now
0,that he was
0,sounds like he was a hell of a man
0,allow a man his version of the past when you get to be my age youve got enough painful memories youre allowed to soften a few of the edges up
0,i know but thats how it should have ended your dad and mom riding off into a new life growing old together happy
0,every time you tell that story you stop there thats not how it ended i was five when my dad got shot

0,tonight why im just getting ready to turn on the younger charm
0,jim you been with a girl yet
0,i was always jealous web mimms got to go off and fight with you and cole now its my turn

0,yeah hey are you drinking whisky youre too young to be drinking whisky
0,you okay jesse
0,no
0,i like that
0,and the same age web was no
0,im the same age you were when you went off to war
0,and youre too young

0,really
0,devereux my brother cole dated a european girl once
0,that is so gentlemanly of you
0,why dont we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk

0,gosh thats a pretty name buy you a drink
0,lyla devereux
0,thank you miss
0,i just though you were awful cute
0,not at all
0,i hope im not being too forward
0,really
0,yes but just so i could find out who you were
0,oh you were talking to jesse
0,i hope you dont mind jesse james told me your name
0,why yeah
0,move you fools
0,theres only four of them
0,they donate money to farmers to churches rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of maddox so much money they were able to build a school
0,how can that be
0,by burning down their homes
0,they had to be dealt with
0,my professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time
0,its not my job to relax ive put men facing out both ways down main street so nobody can ride in shooting ive got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case
0,relax alan the army has this all in hand and mr thaddeus rains will be very pleased with this news nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate
0,im doing you folks a favor
0,well this land is about to be condemned
0,not such a menace now is he pinkerton
0,how did you know
0,i remember you
0,this is him
0,oh that ill let jenkins explain
0,that
0,what sir
0,what is that
0,sir
0,parker
0,i look forward to seeing it
0,the final route for the railroad is complete
0,we should go burn that school to the ground sir
0,with my money
0,what is going on here man
0,your men knew the risks
0,we did
0,then who did
0,to be precise they didnt blow up the tracks
0,ill kill them for blowing up my railway
0,thirtyfive thousand sir coins and currency and the delay from the miles of destroyed track
0,how much did they get from the safe
0,they exchanged fire with the pinkerton guards killing several of them then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile
0,ill teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress
0,i see ill get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight
0,you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool i see a power void to be filled as we have the most power we may move with impunity
0,a further impediment is that the army garrison has been ordered to move on from liberty we will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers
0,just perfect
0,yes sir
0,leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers
0,unfortunately not sir a gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers the redoubtable mr alan pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident
0,good
0,two weeks ago we managed to arrange to have the army hang one of the local farmers
0,parker tell me whats going on so i can return as quickly as possible to boston and my whores and cigars not necessarily in that order
0,i can completely understand your distress sir
0,no it is not my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their pathetic little mudholes so that i may build the greatest railroad that this country has ever seen
0,really
0,and it is my pleasure to be here
0,mr thaddeus rains sir it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field
0,vengeance
0,what the hell is that sound
0,why their intense hatred of you of course
0,what is that
0,no need i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank
0,can you put men at all four
0,there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed
0,in english pinkerton
0,every three months the james gang circles back to the vicinity of liberty missouri they always pull a job right before they return probably to have extra money to give family and friends
0,no
0,so hes won
0,its going to be a long spring
0,cant you tell me anything
0,no you demand results they are not the same thing and if you want results you will let me do my job as i see fit unless of course you want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it
0,i demand action
0,yes thats the way to win the locals back to our side
0,and there are some towns in missouri where james and his men can walk openly as heroes
0,i cant believe this
0,first of all you shut up now youve given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover every time the james gang strikes we shift a hundred detectives to that area but theres just too much open land too many riverbeds to ride caves to hide in this gang operates across four states often riding a hundred miles between jobs
0,all of the james gangs encounters have been with local law enforcement who quite frankly are no match for this groups cunning
0,pinkerton its been eight months i see robberies i see hold ups but i do not see men on the end of nooses
0,its going to be a long winter
0,so you cant tell me anything
0,hardly farmers ive done some checking all these were in the war these men know sabotage tactics and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them they are disciplined welltrained and have a charismatic leader if i were to design the perfect outlaw band this gang is what i would create
0,im losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers
0,its early in the game yet mr rains jesse james and i are just learning how each other moves feeling out each others patterns
0,oh thats the best part
0,the gang made off with thirtyfive thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land who wrote this ill see him hanged every tuesday for a month
0,it is a nice piece of writing
0,a rock island and pacific railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside st louis missouri the brave and daring jamesyounger gang was heavily outnumbered by pinkerton detectives but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the west
0,im afraid our adversaries dont agree
0,this is no game
0,would a jury around here convict their own i think not were beginning an interesting game here mr rains
0,i want them arrested and hanged
0,oh no i would have done that but i would have made sure i killed them too
0,you wouldnt have done that
0,not to mention my men who lost their lives
0,look at this pinkerton they got the payroll and this damage will set construction back two months at least
0,nothing
0,yes
0,patrick
0,yes courtney

0,after i broke into 21 which was insane thank god they didnt catch me i just drove around trying to figure out what possessed me you know what ive been putting my own guilt on gary
0,i remember
0,the justice department guy who came to the apartment when
0,remember lyle barton
0,why
0,its what they said it is an unfinished broadcast studio you were right i just drove to seattle and back
0,nothing
0,nothing
0,its almost nine ive been so worried what did you see in there
0,so you believe me
0,whaddo i do
0,i know how to get in there but youve gotta help me
0,is it two or is it three have you ever really noticed
0,they stop the construction work at six or seven the parking lots mostly clear by two or three in the morning even the early geeks dont get there before five
0,you cant just walk in either
0,i cant just walk away
0,milo you told me those doj agents are all over the place how could they hope to hide a surveillance post and how can you get in there anyway with the cameras and the swipe cards
0,its the only one with dishes on the roof the studios a front thats why they keep postponing its opening gotta get in there
0,even if all this were true therere 20 other buildings all of them filled with computers and
0,how should i know solving a problem i guess or needing to control everything i dont know ive gotta get in there
0,milo why would he
0,you think i dont know that
0,like this its gary youre talking about
0,go where you cant get away from people like this
0,youre scaring me i think we should just go
0,it isnt a broadcast studio its a surveillance post or something thats why they have the dishes on top
0,nobody does work like this online its in your pc or in a mainframe selfcontained theyd have to be like watching people physically oh jesus
0,they hack into peoples programs
0,i dont know i just know it was teddys code all these ideas flying in from everywhere you know how he says any kid working in his garage can put us out of business its like they know what every kids doing
0,i cant see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that
0,i dont know what im saying maybe maybe they hired those guys
0,are you saying you think they had something to do with his death nelson said it was an airtight case
0,it was a hate crime
0,whatre you what
0,teddy was killed last night
0,what
0,youre right its a working relationship dont know what i was expecting
0,i mean if one little comment from gary is gonna upset you this much
0,whats extreme is what that er doctor said when he pumped your stomach eat another sesame seed and thats it
0,isnt that extreme
0,if you cant deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor
0,i know i know
0,hes your boss hes not your
0,thats what im asking myself does he have some genius stowed away why not let him write skywire not saying it makes sense
0,what would it mean anyway if he didnt write it
0,its the way he said it just the way my dad did when he was caught in a lie thats how you knew you were onto something ugly
0,he gave me some new codefixes this morning i said did you really do this just today cause i was impressed he said whatre you implying
0,thats what i need to ask you you know you cant keep anything from me
0,to our new life whats wrong
0,milo what about
0,you know hes never been anybodys counselor before
0,were not gonna let it
0,that took some fun out of
0,probly waiting by the phone for outpost to call well leave it for him
0,whens brian coming for the tv
0,you saved my life in alot of ways
0,dont bring that up like a different girlfriend woulddve let you die
0,cmon i wouldnt have a destiny without you my destiny would be dying at 20 from eating
0,no way you have this destiny
0,i forgot thats why you have to help me decide
0,didnt you visit the campus
0,but
0,i think thats great milo i do
0,if my dadd leveled with me like that even once the weird thing is my fantasy he could somehow be like the old gary its his fantasy too
0,but hes not quite the same guy anymore dont get your hopes too high
0,when i was a kid and he was moving us all over the place i spent all my time writing stuff on outpost 10 i thought gary boyd was the greatest
0,bully are we talking about gary boyd or your dad
0,if hes really a bully he wont cop to it anyway
0,its important
0,then youve gotta ask him about that
0,a lot of what larry says is true they just clone stuff or reverse engineer it and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they
0,cmon how often do you talk to somebody whos been on the cover of time three of four times
0,i think i kind of lost it i was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest most powerful didnt know i even cared about that stuff
0,i dont think he knows how
0,he wasnt acting
0,he said it made sense that garys code was like teddys that that clich about great minds was true said it was all about his own guilt plus he has a tendency to get gary mixedup with his dad once in a while it always passes
0,prick
0,lisas an extremely valuable member of the skywire team weve got our eyes on her you keep yours on milo
0,instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl fire her or something
0,thatll be a test wont it
0,hell tell me when he gets home
0,not like him is it to do a thing like that without telling you youre not losing your hold on him are you
0,no
0,didnt mention he was going to the justice department
0,yes sir
0,and outpost youre happy there
0,just didnt know who else to talk to
0,let me look into it see whats being done frankly its not my area
0,i just wanna help bring these guys to justice theyre neonazis
0,if theres a civil rights violation but generally we let the local police and da do their work first
0,it was racially motivated hes chinese he was and i know sometimes the fbi gets involved with that dont they
0,my goodness
0,my friend my best friend teddy was killed in silicon valley

0,right whats that mean again

0,and the kid who wrote skywire then gave it away theyre calling him the digital robin hood
0,stigma larry 60 billion buys you some slack in this world
0,isnt there a stigma bankrolling this guy
0,theres no hard evidence he knew about this anybody who could implicate him seems tove vanished
0,thatd change with a criminal indictment
0,conglomeratesre lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites theyll pay him a huge premium to get online
0,outpost doesnt own em
0,outpost was his baby sure on the other hand we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites personally
0,thats gotta kill him right
0,i think they call him the houseman cause guard sounds too weird
0,whos that
0,he just likes to write code hes bummed theres so much secrecy and competition everybody trying to own everything
0,we could move em up here
0,hes pretty tight with his family
0,couldnt convince teddy to come
0,oh hi
0,milo im danny
0,i do know you focus on the big problem but somewhere down the chain something breaks down something gets destroyed at first its upsetting you feel youve lost control
0,im pretty close but when i wrote the last contact switches it wiped out a piece of the content filer you know what its like writing software
0,i do know gary i feel the same way i thought i was coming here for a job but its meant a lot more

0,just once guess i was worried we didnt have anything to talk about since work was offlimits non disclosure
0,had you talked to him much lately
0,were the flags for teddy
0,i heard what happened
0,definitely
0,it scales dont you think
0,the purpose of this company isnt to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath but the software business is binary youre a zero or a one being obsessive isnt a crime its a character trait
0,im sure
0,everything i do is under scrutiny the questions they ask trying to make anything strategic look sordid im confused doesnt everybody in business try to get ahead
0,nothing
0,whatre you implying
0,you really wrote this just today
0,right right
0,well you sent for me
0,milo whats up
0,youre making me young again
0,you did this overnight
0,take a look at this slightly different approach
0,its okay really
0,too fast at least four companiesre on the verge of workable convergence systems milo they
0,maybe im going too fast
0,hows it going
0,dont spend too much time searching you ever vetted somebodys old code before its a different skill stay close to the surface the besthidden secrets are in plain sight you know the best place to hide a leaf right in a tree
0,could work with a new switch there may be a few more things hidden
0,thats what i told her my wife
0,thats insane youre ahead of your time
0,somebody said im just another philistine with reproductions
0,do i
0,think i should buy some originals
0,okay im gary
0,no just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself
0,yeah i wanna feel like i did when i wrote that but im 42 thats 100 in cyberyears i look at you and see the things that got me here but somehow got away
0,i do
0,when you get to a certain age you start wondering about your legacy i doubt you even remember outpost 10
0,youd have to start practically from scratch but this is all youd be working on no marketing meetings no product seminars we cant waste the time half the valleys working on convergence sore media conglomerates cable companies phone companies cant finish second milo there is no second now what would you like to ask me
0,it needs a more objectoriented language this doesnt scale does it
0,the content filer has tbe written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms really omniplatforms including whatever new hardware emerges
0,skywire
0,among other things we know convergence is the real superhighway all the pcs tvs phones etc linked together why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky
0,low enough to relay internet traffic
0,ive only shown this to three other people i bought 200 weve launched 12 so far i keep the coordinates in this room its left over from sdi reagans star wars technology they orbit 426 miles up
0,theres a rumor going around maybe youve heard it
0,you know a lot about art i guess
0,oh no thanks
0,would you like a coke or something
0,cool
0,you would wow when would we come think he hung up
0,milo gary boyd im hoping you and your friend can come up here weve made some amazing strides in digital convergence id love to show them to you
0,hello
0,just do it
0,gary
0,knows im altering the coordinates lets jump to 12
0,what
0,wait he knows
0,longitude 109
0,lets go
0,ready for number three
0,longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes
0,okay 2
0,just do what im asking
0,gary dont worry we
0,help me change the skywire settings add five degrees to each satellite coordinate
0,nothing does still i want him to like me
0,hasnt affected his work though
0,there may be a little less trust after your outburst
0,whatd the girl say
0,maybe we should all get on it
0,startup not 50 miles from here kids on prozac
0,this is good who did it
0,cool
0,you guysll be using teddys old space is that okay
0,got out of my other commitment
0,you wanna work here
0,well come up with the next big thing
0,your app kind of blew mine out of the water
0,those really weird short lines
0,man could he write code totally elegant he had his own style
0,its only meaningful when youve got 40000 lines of code to back it up
0,he was on the verge of something too he was gonna show us the next day he said the answers not in the box its in the band know what it means
0,just thought his work should go on
0,you are naive look at your employment contract you cant work anywhere else in this field for at least few years not that i dont miss you
0,i know you lost all his work maybe i could come down here and
0,i mean its your life
0,you do
0,i think you should go
0,in exchange for endowments they should just drop the pretense and name the schools after em
0,all the companies know the faculties tell em at the target schools
0,i launched skywire just pray the last set of coordinates milo sent me connected us to garys satellite
0,now what are we doing i dont get any of this shit
0,where we going
0,come with me
0,im calling gary
0,you calling phil and randy
0,they know just they dont trust me with it so well get the evidence first ask questions later
0,get the backslash the colon keys kids dont use but geeks do what would milo want in here anyway
0,lets get him in here
0,delbert seems to enter 21 twice without leaving the first time
0,any irregularity in the pattern
0,whatre we looking for
0,keep looking
0,every entry was authorized
0,not yet love to bust my ass cause im not in frigging mensa i swear to god its that kid milo i told em so in the first place but they didnt even wanna hear about it lets run a printout on card entries
0,unlikely all 14 cameras are frozen do we call randy and phil tell em there may have been a breakin
0,could it be a glitch something the construction workers caused
0,wait a second he knows i know
0,latitude 47 degrees
0,hes been altering the coordinates since we logged on hes a step ahead lets jump to 12
0,what
0,he knows
0,lets try 2
0,maybe its the satellite
0,but you said the other
0,bring it to the other location
0,its three years old it
0,they know i had no choice get out of the house now do you have a laptop
0,tell me youre not calling on your car phone
0,meet me at the other location
0,at this point the worst thing i could do is anything out of the ordinary
0,please dont go
0,she called to apologize i said i was pulling an allnighter she said then come home just to say hi which i always do when we fight its suspicious if i dont
0,why
0,he suspects i know something i think he was sort of explaining himself to me in case i do we have to go in tonight im two hours from a beta version but ive gotta go home for an hour
0,does he know you know
0,youll come up with something
0,thats lame isnt it
0,you could always say you have to go the bathroom
0,perfect how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to
0,same with the excerpts im choosing theyll play against any of the images you described
0,milo what if shrot notices somebody entered the day care at four am and tells them about it
0,oh
0,yeah thats old in a tree
0,hardly anybody does thats the beauty part no cameras the doj doesnt bother with it its accessed by a tunnel they boast about you know the best place to hide a leaf
0,he doesnt know about the day care
0,they know i broke in alice helped me shrots not one of them hes blundering into this on his own
0,milo shrot suspects somebody broke into 21 i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts
0,thank god
0,the dishes are juiced up too
0,great i knocked off the aglet as soon as i get a passable version of skywire were there
0,gary
0,i felt guilty cause i owed so much to alice but even then i was starting to wonder is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you if you have a lucrative skill its all anybody wants from you you grow older but you dont grow up you turn into into
0,a beautiful geek whatre the chances
0,whatd he say
0,i told teddy about you
0,cause their apartments might be bugged
0,think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are
0,oh i liked you i was checking you out
0,why were you snooping in my office
0,i thought the worst they would do is fire me who knew they took termination so literally
0,why were you so careless
0,and what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 arent hot yet you said the place isnt finished
0,i dont know
0,you mean break in
0,oh man id have to get into garys house to get the satellite positions
0,before they kill somebody else too
0,gary knows im close on skywire we have to do this fast
0,its a standard gui once ive got a concept its maybe three days work
0,youd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop maybe some audio too to tie it all in to gary how long would that take you
0,but theyd still get the idea right
0,its how online services push logos they wanna sell you you dont ask for em they just appear have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house and then the quality of the broadcast wouldnt exactly be digital thats 12 months away
0,a what
0,we cant just assume theyre standing by to receive skywire 12 months from launch id have to write in an aglet
0,hes got 12 satellites up hes got dishes on top of 21 hes building this meganetwork for skywire lets use it
0,what
0,how close are you
0,timewarner has a 40 per cent stake in garys settop device that also takes out cnn ge joins outpost in new venture which means nbc is out disney joins outpost abc is out outpost and newscorp in new deal fox is out any of these places could have a mole or all of em its like a a continuous loop we can go to some alternative press place that 1000 people read get them and us killed but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something garys got a finger in
0,time
0,say theres just one mole working there like barton at the doj how do we know hes not the guy weve contacted or she or the guy she works for
0,but still you cant say cbs wouldnt love to break something like
0,yeah they dig stuff like this cbs news has partnered with outpost information systems in a cable news network due to launch fall of 2001
0,what about 60 minutes
0,hes buying up pretty much everything cable companies baby bells picture libraries museum rights film archives getting ready for skywire
0,certainly not at my happy home
0,we could crossreference a data base on media ownership but not on our own computers not even at home
0,right but garys tiedin to a lot of media conglomerates have to be careful who we pick
0,the mainstream media tv or a newsmagazine
0,therere so many disinformation sites about gary already where he has devils horns or they crop him in with saddam hussein
0,do we post it on the net
0,theres always a logical answer you just have to define the question
0,who can we trust
0,theyve got this guy in the doj maybe others we tell the wrong person its over
0,what about the fbi
0,no no never
0,i always felt if a boy i liked ever found out hed run hed think i was unclean
0,hmm
0,milo
0,theyre already watching you if they had to theyd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout hed wake up not even remembering his act of revenge
0,hes out of prison
0,theyd frame him
0,is that my scenario tell me
0,oh yeah
0,i know why youre so secretive why you wont let anybody near you i know what he did to you
0,you know there is no second place and whats the risk the killingsre undetectable theyre handtailored they make sense i mean theyre in the information business they have scenarios for all of us too in case we find out too much
0,but why would they
0,its easy to know who the smart geeks are the schools tell em they upload medical files school records pharmacy files theyd be happy just to steal code forever but when a program gets close to fruition like teddy he was almost there
0,the day care
0,you thought about it too youve been suspicious for a while but its not happening in there its happening in the day care
0,why would you do a thing like
0,i snuck into 21
0,she saved my life
0,thats great i didnt know
0,then and now but not right now
0,so when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers was that then or now
0,long story not that interesting
0,whys that
0,mmmmore like i have a little trouble trusting people
0,youre compulsive
0,maybe once i rewrote it anyway
0,right right but does he ever just like hand you code
0,mines not the ceo he barely remembers to take a shower
0,there is no second place plus every time i get jammedup gary has an inspiration is it like that with your counselor
0,they just pushed up the schedule on skywire apps how fast are you going
0,no please
0,did you wanna be alone
0,yeah i ran it for lots of platforms ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to
0,cool
0,show me
0,graphical interfaces for skywire im sposed to coordinate with you
0,whatve you got there
0,no i know what you mean i used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers least they make sense sometimes you think theyve betrayed you like a person would but then you see no you just missed a step you can go back and make it all work
0,did i say something
0,didnt mean to pry i just have this theory some of us who got to good at this we were escaping something
0,something like that yeah
0,me too were you an army brat or something
0,we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers
0,were you
0,i wouldnt worry about it youve gotta figure most people around here were their teachers pets
0,im getting a teachers pet rep
0,youre famous around here
0,you know mine
0,you know my name
0,lisa
0,i didnt plan this
0,milo geeks dont have two girlfriends most dont have one
0,what does that mean
0,i dunno i guess larrys got me totally suspicious of that place
0,what dyou mean
0,a beautiful geek i dont wanna sound paranoid or like a pig but whatre the chances
0,no i keep thinking itll go away but theres this connection shes been hacking since she was little she had to move around a lot plus i see her every day were working on the same program shes beautiful
0,did you tell alice
0,i dont know
0,what come on is it serious
0,i met this girl
0,im cool they didnt touch the machine or my disks probably didnt know what they were so you a moonie yet milo
0,jesus teddy
0,theyre in the neighborhood they usually hassle vietnamese grocers
0,what
0,but these like white supremacists trashed my office last week
0,outpost made me sign 1000 guess well find out what else we have to talk about life stuff
0,we rented a loft in sunnyvale you know whats the bad part we cant talk about work anymore were competitors the venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms
0,hey we got seed money for the startup a millionfive
0,wanted to say goodbye to him
0,uh not exactly
0,is that how larry feels
0,and your phone messages you wanna do what you do its not a crime
0,you got my email
0,you wanna survive in the software business you cover your bets i gotta say this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested
0,garys not into fiber optics hes betting everything on the satellites
0,21 way behind schedule its top secret but everybody knows its a digital broadcast space they see the dishes on top the fiber optics going in
0,whatre they building
0,right thats rare around here you know how nuns remarried to jesus posties are married to outpost
0,ive got a girlfriend remember
0,heavy graphical background doing designinterface for skywire apps youll be working with her
0,shes a programmer
0,every geek heres got a thing for lisa but thats about the biggest reaction shes had to anybody
0,well he micromanaged the company till it got too big guess he needs to micromanage something
0,his snapples were in alphabetical order
0,so howd you like the house
0,oh were not going to the campus
0,so how far are we from the campus
0,you dont look anything like a three yearold
0,damn have to go back over there be so much easier if we could walk in the front door
0,did you download corey in san jose
0,yeah yeah
0,speaking of which
0,maybe hell get back to work
0,there is no public offering the guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in san luis obispo wrote this just to run their web site
0,can we buy into their ipo or is that a justice dept problem
0,we tried the big vaporware number gary its nosale
0,were all grateful for that really go out the way you came in
0,wait a second im the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place
0,fellas im gonna have to ask you to leave here now

0,thanks
0,be careful

0,im leaving oh and austin
0,i think if everyone were honest theyd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag

0,my god austin what have you done
0,good god and underground missile weve long feared such a development
0,maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle ive uncovered the details on project vulcan its a new subterranean warhead delivery system
0,indeed if we could get back to the business at hand its one thing to have a warhead its quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it
0,circus folk nomads you know they smell like cabbage
0,what
0,carnies
0,whats the other thing youre scared of
0,excuse me
0,whats the other
0,thank you exposition only two things scare me and one is nuclear war
0,austin vanessa let me bring you up to speed dr evil has high jacked a nuclear warhead from kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for onehundred billion dollars if the world doesnt pay up in four days hes threatening to destroy the world
0,hello exposition
0,thank you
0,be careful
0,yes
0,theres one more thing austin
0,oh yes thank you

0,be careful
0,yes
0,oh and austin
0,thank you exposition
0,hello austin hello vanessa this is basil exposition from british intelligence theres a company in las vegas called virtucon that we think may be linked to dr evil many of the virtucon executives gamble at the hotelcasino where youll be staying thats the first place you should look well im off to the chat rooms

0,you might also experience a slight fever dry mouth and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation austin this is commander gilmour strategic command and general borschevsky russian intelligence
0,yes im having trouble controlling the volume of my voice
0,the shouting is a temporary side effect of the unfreezing process
0,who are these people
0,youre in the ministry of defense its 1997 youve been cryogenically frozen for thirty years
0,where am i
0,thank you lets go baby
0,be careful
0,yes
0,oh and austin
0,thank you
0,good luck austin
0,just where youd never think to look for him well be there
0,im afraid not earlier this week dr evil escaped from zedel edel prison in baaden baaden and now hes planning a trap for you tonight at the electric psychedelic pussycat swingers club in picadilly circus here in swinging london
0,dr evil i thought i put him in jail for good
0,i just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows whats going on at any given time weve just received word that dr evil the ultimate square is planning to take over the world
0,we know all that exposition
0,hello austin this is basil exposition chief of british intelligence youre austin powers international man of mystery and youre with agent mrs kensington the year is 1967 and youre talking on a picture phone
0,groovy
0,good on ya man
0,you cant always get what you want thats a great title for a song im gonna write that and itll be a big hit
0,well you cant always get what you want
0,are you more satisfied now sexually austin
0,hey mick
0,hey austin powers its me mick jagger
0,love is love is love is
0,why not its a question
0,that does not compute
0,really let me ask you this what is love
0,yes i am programmed to answer any question
0,well destructacon 5000 you have quite a head on your shoulders i dare to coin
0,good afternoon mr powers im the destructacon 5000 im programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point you might as well surrender resistance is futile your odds of survival are 23763273 to
0,man you are one chilly square
0,not really kill the little bastard see what i care
0,it seems the tables have turned again dr evil
0,really theres nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster
0,thats why right now is a very groovy time man we still have freedom but we also have responsibility
0,your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan i ever dreamed of face it freedom failed
0,no man what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you whose bag was money and world domination we were innocent man if wed known the consequences of our sexual liberation we would have done things differently but the spirit would have remained the same its freedom man
0,well done mr powers were not so different you and i its true youre british and im belgian you have a full head of hair mine is slightly receding youre thin im about forty pounds overweight ok we are different im not making a very good point however isnt it ironic mr powers that the very things you stand for swinging free love parties distrust of authority are all now in the nineties considered to be evil maybe we have more in common than you care to admit
0,ive got you dr evil
0,no mr powers i expect them to die even after they pay me the money im still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma all right guard begin the unnecessarily slowmoving dipping mechanism
0,dr evil do you really expect them to pay
0,oh forget it as a fellow player on the international stage mr powers im sure youll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act
0,im sorry baby im just not grocking your head space

0,dont you think we should ask for more than a million dollars a million dollars isnt that much money these days
0,right oh hell lets just do what we always do lets hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage gentlemen its come to my attention that a breakaway russian republic called kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the united nations in a few days heres the plan we get the warhead and we hold the world ransom for one million dollars
0,umm that also has already happened
0,people have to tell me these things ive been frozen for thirty years throw me a bone here ok no problem heres my second plan back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a laser using this laser we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth which we scientists call the ozone layer slowly but surely ultraviolet rays would pour in increasing the risk of skin cancer that is unless the world pays us a hefty ransom
0,um dr evil prince charles did have an affair he admitted it and they are now divorced actually
0,gentlemen i have a plan its called blackmail the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like prince charles the heir to the throne has had an affair outside of marriage and therefore they would have to divorce
0,we also own the franklin mint which makes decorative handpainted theme plates for collectors some plates like the gone with the wind series have gone up in value as much as twohundred and forty percent but as with any investment there is some risk involved
