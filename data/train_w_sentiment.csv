0,shes in here,0.6031231
0,wait,0.9787107
0,youll never believe what this unruly customer just said,0.5549718
0,all those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed casualties of a war they had nothing to do with all right lookyoure a roofer and some juicy government contract comes your way you got the wife and kids and the twostory in suburbiathis is a government contract which means all sorts of benefits all of a sudden these leftwing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a threemile radius you didnt ask for that you have no personal politics youre just trying to scrape out a living,0.3284562
0,all right so even if independent contractors are working on the death star why are you uneasy with its destruction,0.4277384
0,exactly in order to get it built quickly and quietly theyd hire anybody who could do the job do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main all they know is killing and white uniforms,0.5698676
0,not just imperials is what youre getting at,0.4772839
0,a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer ill bet there were independent contractors working on that thing plumbers aluminum siders roofers,0.7900916
0,so,0.2162681
0,the second time around it wasnt even finished yet they were still under construction,0.02765095
0,and the second time around,0.7809165
0,so when they blew it up no prob evil is punished,0.09202936
0,basically,0.6015862
0,well the thing is the first death star was manned by the imperial army storm troopers dignitariesthe only people onboard were imperials,0.5998634
0,and you figured it out,0.9604902
0,something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it i could never put my finger on itsomething just wasnt right,0.01313743
0,compliments of lando calrissian,0.8765877
0,and the second one was still being built when they blew it up,0.319862
0,luke blew it up give credit where its due,0.5530754
0,now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it,0.4797541
0,yeah,0.7554327
0,so they build another death star right,0.8050737
0,theres more,0.3475639
0,you know what else i noticed in jedi,0.5679338
0,i think they were catholics,0.2349452
0,the only problem is that at no point in the series did i ever hear leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief,0.09185833
0,more or less,0.7488182
0,hence the empire was a fascist theocracy and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution,0.6136979
0,it would stand to reason yes,0.6865277
0,then wouldnt that logically mean that its a theocracy if the head of the empire is a priest of some sort then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion,0.5635215
0,yeah,0.7554327
0,now hes in charge of the empire the imperial government is under his control and the entire galaxy is under imperial rule,0.8320032
0,i guess,0.4234413
0,well hes like the pope for the dark side of the force hes a holy man a shaman kind of albeit an evil one,0.7974576
0,how do you mean,0.5146909
0,right the emperor now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure yes,0.9462041
0,the emperor,0.6413144
0,all right vaders boss,0.8639781
0,whats that,0.7309588
0,there was something else going on in jedi i never noticed it until today,0.3057969
0,empire had the better ending luke gets his hand cut off and finds out vaders his father han gets frozen and taken away by boba fett it ends on such a down note and thats lifea series of down endings all jedi had was a bunch of muppets,0.0123541
0,blasphemy,0.212721
0,empire,0.9576432

0,i think its safe to say yes,0.8483372
0,caitlins on the same wavelength,0.9205958
0,i think the arguments veronica and i are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that i can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with caitlin,0.8945756
0,what about veronica,0.6791505

0,anything happening in there el,0.5509207
0,im not sure we have no launch protocol the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation,0.06966551
0,what,0.5182157
0,i dont know ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology,0.2925724
0,you dont believe it to be tell me something doctor why do you think they would go to all this trouble bring you tens of thousands of light years and then send you home without a shred of proof sort of bad form wouldnt you say what was their intent,0.7667674
0,all the elements are there a woman orphaned young under a great deal of stress the failure of a project shes staked her selfworth and very sense of identity on induces a fantasy of reuniting with her father in heaven as it were is it possible,0.7359012
0,is it possible,0.5750707
0,dr arroway do you think its possible you had some kind of delusional episode,0.7392232
0,yes sir,0.9293455
0,he died in 1972,0.0105756
0,yes sir,0.9293455
0,and this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you as your father,0.9555036
0,its extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at,0.02875285
0,or youre our kind of people,0.7242384
0,its a hoax i knew it,0.4670203
0,what in the hell,0.2647458
0,how is that possible how could all that information be encoded in,0.6842063
0,hope theres a cartoon,0.7471932
0,okay fine theyve got the primes but if youre right about there being another more significant transmission still to come,0.4290845
0,mike because of the earths rotation were only in line with vega so many hours a day the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations if dr arroway hadnt moved quickly we could have lost key elements,0.008817799
0,dr arroway let me first say,0.8162559
0,michael kitz national security advisor,0.5599143
0,dr arroway,0.4106796
0,so there wasnt any clothes in the machine she was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the maytag listening,0.1596555
0,so,0.2162681
0,last week about 3 am fish dr fisher was on a late shift and he found her doing laundry,0.1327621
0,tell me,0.4612661
0,nothing okay some of us have been a little not concerned exactly but,0.4661117
0,still settling in really wheres dr arroway,0.2430587
0,glad to have you david hows the new office,0.9743592
0,now i remember why i went into theoretical work kent,0.170711
0,for giving me a chance just for a moment to feel what it must be like to be you,0.8263465
0,thank you,0.9940044
0,nothing i guess i just wanted to thank you,0.8589355
0,what would you have me say david,0.7778336
0,ellie we both know that if i was any kind of a man i never wouldve entered this race that i would have told the president straight out helen eleanor arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass but shes got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together that more then anyone else on the planet shes earned this and that she should be the one to go because shes the best we have but thats not who i am i like to think its who i mightve been if things had gone a different way that i might have been worthy really worthy of what ive been given you do what you have to do and in the end as with everything it comes down to power and it isnt fair,0.3098854
0,good luck david,0.9824933
0,right well,0.8192717
0,this seemed best,0.6285713
0,you arent staying,0.3588225
0,maybe they are maybe this is all part of the package the building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale maybe requiring us to come together in this way was in effect part of the plan,0.7930978
0,they knew our level of development if as you say theyve done this many times theyd be well aware of the implications,0.6909005
0,i cant believe they wouldnt take something as basic as our biological needs into account,0.1121146
0,two years is still a hell of a long time and as far as we can tell there arent any provisions in the machine design for storing food water even air,0.5963395
0,excuse me im late for a meeting,0.4785745
0,you,0.854744
0,as of three oclock this afternoon i submitted my resignation,0.7390364
0,what,0.5182157
0,ellie you should know that im no longer the presidents science advisor,0.5357133
0,im asking for your help david i want to go theyll need someone relatively young unattached and probably a scientist as the presidents science advisor you have enormous weight im asking if youll support my candidacy,0.8375998
0,i dont understand,0.160742
0,david i know weve had our differences but ive always thought of you as a fair man even when weve disagreed and its in that light im hoping youll consider my request,0.899076
0,itll just take a moment,0.5847807
0,actually im running late,0.2848642
0,do you have a minute,0.747
0,ellie,0.7783467
0,david,0.7760931
0,you were right ellie you were right all along,0.6460469
0,you mean,0.4892728
0,weve cracked it lunacharsky found it,0.7304904
0,what is it whats happened,0.1953313
0,interesting analogy and how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in africa,0.5026808
0,ms president this is communist paranoia right out of war of the worlds there is no reason whatsoever to believe the etis intentions are hostile we pose no threat to them it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in africa,0.1794525
0,its not a threat ellie its a fact if youre not careful you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly play ball really its good advice,0.9351379
0,are you threatening me,0.111586
0,i want you to listen to me carefully the minute the implications of this message became clear this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one an extremely complex extremely volatile one there are forces at work here you dont understand i can help you up to a point but only up to a point,0.6788869
0,ellie,0.7783467
0,im going to convert mr scienceis therootofallevil this is absurd david we have work to do here i dont have time to play babysitter to the god squad,0.1349638
0,apparently hes genuinely interested in science this could be a chance to win him over,0.6623948
0,with me,0.5887293
0,the theological ramifications of all this are obvious the president feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them shes also named palmer joss as their liaison hes requested a meeting with you,0.8019558
0,what why,0.0775002
0,arrangements also have to be made for the vips coming in mostly religious leaders,0.7638397
0,rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise,0.8555341
0,throw a gray scale on it standard interpolation,0.4120865
0,you must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already,0.1514558
0,could it be a nested code of some sort,0.5886259
0,its hardly yesterday the signals been traveling for over twentysix years as for why im hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out to see if theres another message buried deeper in the signal,0.1999065
0,if its attention you want id say youve got it just one thing why vega everyones looked at vega for years with no results and now yesterday they start broadcasting primes why,0.608963
0,mathematics is the only truly universal language senator we think this may be a beacon an announcement to get our attention,0.7446563
0,it was a worthy experiment worthy of you i was wrong about that part but its over now,0.3520808
0,david,0.7760931
0,then why havent you detected any signals if as you claim there have been thousands millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasnt one signal gotten through itll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through youre welcome to stay until then,0.2637253
0,goddamnit they are out there david,0.278135
0,no youre not but the price has just gotten too high,0.03423058
0,the difference being what that i refuse to adopt the standard line that i dont care about the results of my work well i do care of course any discovery has to be verifiable of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method but i refuse to go around pretending im some kind of dispassionate automaton when its obvious to anyone with a brain im just not,0.5378038
0,the point is this isnt just scientific inquiry anymore its turned into some kind of personal obsession,0.2503539
0,im searching for patterns in the noise thats all order in the chaos im practicing listening,0.7374796
0,meaning i have to go defend a budget to the president and to congress and youre out here listening to washing machines,0.1452792
0,meaning,0.8976494
0,its not like youve given me much choice,0.2759674
0,you cant just pull the plug david,0.4446759
0,ellie i should have done this a long time ago certainly before i left the nsf but i wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt,0.3008338
0,its not enough having my search time systematically cut down you know im down to three hours a week now,0.1967623
0,you know why im here,0.2751868
0,did i tell you weve expanded the search spectrum were including several other possible magic frequencies not just the hydrogen line anymore i was trying to get inside their heads yknow and i started thinking what other constants are there in the universe besides hydrogen and then suddenly it was so obvious transcendantals right so weve been trying variations of pi,0.02554546
0,ellie,0.7783467
0,no doubt,0.231452
0,now exactly its complicated,0.3783918
0,presidents science advisor so what you just spend all your time jetting around on air force one now,0.8794152
0,im surprised you even knew it was an election year,0.8034317
0,really congratulations by the way,0.8502497
0,very well since my appointment hes been made interim director,0.5134503
0,oh hows he doing,0.5088615
0,peter sends his regards,0.7241104
0,no thanks,0.7729614
0,pepsi tequila,0.7752135
0,then disagree but dont stand in my way,0.6770746
0,i disagree,0.7834421
0,what if youre wrong no ill grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence you cant deny the possibility and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly profound is worth investigation and worth taking a few risks,0.9912151
0,two theres nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and youd be wasting your time,0.4456652
0,youre,0.9158983
0,and only two probabilities one there is intelligent life in the universe but theyre so far away youll never contact it in your lifetime,0.70507
0,dr drumlin we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity there are over four hundred billion stars out there,0.8066635
0,im not youre far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense,0.1616689
0,im willing to take that risk,0.6123785
0,im sorry miss arroway not only is it too speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation at this point in your career itd be tantamount to suicide,0.1029825
0,well,0.869893
0,whats the status of the decryption effort,0.3702361
0,yes of course all im saying is this message was written in the language of science mathematics and was clearly intended to be received by scientists if it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush or a booming voice from the sky,0.7292193
0,mr ranks organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families dr arroway feel free to disagree but there wont be any suppressing of opinions here today,0.9938818
0,a transport so are they coming or are we going,0.7397068
0,and while its function remains for the moment a mystery my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind,0.7863423
0,how soon will you be able to decode it,0.6858813
0,because you cut it from the budget three years running,0.5056684
0,it could be anything the first volume of some encyclopedia galactica,0.6758407
0,what does it say,0.7249776
0,i dont know maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere but if there is i sure as hell cant find it,0.04022999
0,how can that be,0.7864915
0,no primer,0.2166952
0,and,0.6370114
0,weve repeated a few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one,0.9832225
0,what,0.5182157
0,maybe itll be at the end of the data when the message recycles,0.3242496
0,theres no way of knowing without a key a primer to help us maybe never,0.3602428
0,a third layer,0.6913549
0,in ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing it was called a palimpsest,0.3973308
0,what,0.5182157
0,analyzing signal polarization shifts,0.1756568

0,hows the spying tonight guys,0.8832257
0,i scanned it at arecibo negative results always,0.6062572
0,that cant be right its only twentysix light years away,0.1416266
0,put it on speakers,0.7803894
0,hydrogen times pi got it strong sucker,0.7162706
0,im not sure you mind checking right ascension 18 hours 34 minutes declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes,0.7925935
0,got a bogey boss,0.4367844

0,its incredibly rich weve been cataloging it in frames or pages right now were on 10413,0.4743744
0,i think we just hit the cosmic jackpot,0.8016558
0,its a civilian facility,0.4422441
0,cant we get rid of them,0.1066473
0,it cant be coming from vega the systems too young,0.1792632
0,okay lets just slow down pull up the starfield signal origin,0.5691774
0,thank you mr sensitive im coming at this wrong missing something something,0.4962836
0,youve only searched what is it sixteen hundred stars without a peep try not to take it too personally,0.607514
0,never seen the optical sky myself but i hear its nice too,0.765011
0,its beautiful,0.9045725
0,its how i hear it the displays just a little something i programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight,0.7224849

0,dr cullers,0.4106796
0,because i cant,0.07688824
0,so why dont you admit what by your own standards must be the truth that this experience simply didnt happen,0.9473066
0,but i dont believe it to be the truth,0.3284697
0,thank you doctor now,0.9284321
0,is it possible yes but,0.2908628
0,please answer the question doctor,0.7641596
0,by our standards yes,0.8425734
0,in fact by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible,0.7753119
0,i dont have the figures in front of me but yes that sounds about right,0.4527618
0,and current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes youre talking about even for a fraction of a second would require more energy than our sun produces in a year is that correct,0.5993331
0,there is no direct evidence no,0.2490489
0,i dont have an official response michael all i have are the same questions you have,0.1932247
0,is that your official response,0.7649026
0,i dont understand it all i can think is that maybe because the video gear wasnt accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design,0.1178867
0,thats terrific but theres one problem we dont have the means to receive all the data on our own,0.2505108
0,if at some later date the message proves harmless we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world but until then,0.941974
0,pardon me but you cant do,0.1286008
0,and a hundred mile airspace,0.8923385
0,and a hundred mile airspace,0.8923385
0,colonel jarrod id like a twenty mile radiosilent perimeter put around this installation immediately,0.7847595
0,you dont seem to understand that its your interests im trying to protect,0.3947258
0,which well also need the networks help to receive and decode,0.52929
0,you want to classify prime numbers,0.6511149
0,im saying you might have consulted us the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive,0.5287293
0,this isnt a person to person call mr kitz i dont really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for americans,0.5628271
0,ill come right to the point doctor your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of national security,0.8536637
0,childhood is over ellie its time to grow up,0.380046
0,no please,0.0720872
0,its time to go home now,0.4273258
0,ellie this is the way its been done for billions of years,0.5967489
0,please if you downloaded everything about us you know the problems we face the impact it could have it could make the difference,0.7531888
0,no more stalling captain,0.1809515
0,but you said you wanted to help dont you see what it would mean,0.6493763
0,that isnt the way it works,0.3843442
0,but other people from our planet should see what ive seen they should witness this for themselves,0.6730716
0,eventually youll get here on your own this was just the first step in time youll take another,0.9768373
0,none taken but do we get to come back others of my kind i mean,0.2145262
0,if we dont engineer a consistent causality itll work itself out on its own and thats almost always worse ellie according to your physics none of this is possible a lot of it youre simply not capable of understanding not yet no offense,0.3080308
0,no i mean why so soon,0.07057561
0,now you go home,0.747186
0,so what happens now,0.4742041
0,you always have been were all descendants of the same stars ellie all made of the same primordial atoms,0.4696409
0,all those voices you gather them all together millions of intelligences in one consciousness and now were a part of it,0.7540239
0,the librarian or the library,0.3664401
0,am i one or many,0.6343089
0,can you help us,0.8290226
0,life is unspeakably rare so whenever we do find another civilization especially one thats struggling we send a message sometimes we can offer help sometimes we cant but we always try life is simply too precious not to,0.8146958
0,you have your mothers hands there are no tests ellie we dont sit in judgment think of us more as librarians curators of the universes rarest and most valuable creation,0.8350121
0,so we passed some kind of test,0.847192
0,not all some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams some never make it this far,0.5440956
0,the scale its just so all the civilizations you detect they all end up coming here,0.404264
0,we dont know whoever they were they were gone long before we ever got here,0.1144238
0,so who,0.6864399
0,oh we didnt build it the transit system has been in place for billions of years were just its caretakers,0.04903642
0,and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built,0.404467
0,many others,0.7445903
0,and those other docking ports i saw i mean there are others,0.613356
0,you contacted us we were simply listening weve been listening for millions of years,0.9147815
0,why did you contact us,0.5714827
0,small moves captain small moves,0.6589561
0,can you show me,0.7730939
0,originally just another species like yourselves well not like you at all actually but,0.6116222
0,so who what are you,0.8075751
0,we thought this might make things a little easier,0.8563817
0,but youre so i mean how could you possibly when i was unconscious you downloaded my thoughts my memories even this beach ive never been here but i remember its how i always imagined pensacola,0.427168
0,am i artifact or dream you might ask that about anything,0.8704979
0,so are you an hallucination or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin,0.8962081

0,ellie even if you do manage to raise the money have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this i mean a college fetish is one thing but were talking about your career you wont be publishing you wont be taken seriously and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all,0.8141752
0,weve been going after some of the big multinationals but without much luck got a donation from a new york dowager weve even been thinking about selling tshirts,0.1479842

0,they cant i think its against human nature to admit to that level of insignificance to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe,0.9683969
0,im just so sick of feeling defensive about the things i care about or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like drumlin when if theyd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts,0.4462383

0,hes an incredible prick but i never learned so much in my life,0.70923
0,its beautiful but it does get a little lonely sometimes i think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isnt to avoid excess radio traffic but because were all such pathetic antisocial misfits speaking of which howre you getting on with the old man,0.2559367
0,drumlin said youre been down at arecibo for the last year,0.3294549
0,something my dad they said after all the suffering after all the desolation of the void the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other the one thing that makes it bearable is love,0.650023
0,meaning,0.8976494
0,im not sure maybe it simply exists in the search for it maybe its something we have to make for ourselves,0.4881442
0,does that mean you think it doesnt exist,0.3250425
0,i dont know if it was a god it was searching for a greater one it was still searching for meaning,0.3945153
0,in other words,0.7806677
0,in other words god works in mysterious ways,0.993785
0,maybe what you experienced cant be reduced to images on a videotape maybe they still plan to grant your request only in their own way in their own time or maybe its just like you said ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology,0.5951461
0,but it is a good question and i suppose ill always wonder about the answer why would they send me back without proof,0.7063985
0,ellie if you go out there like this if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didnt actually happen im afraid they really will crucify you please for your own sake for the sake of the world tell them what you know to be the truth tell them it really happened,0.9979184
0,i want to palmer more than anything but it has to be real it has to be true,0.1620581
0,have you seen whats happening out there the terror the despair the world is on fire ellie people need something they can believe in something worthy and you can give it to them,0.9170775
0,but,0.006435468
0,ellie the only one holding you to that standard is you the people want to hear your story they need to hear it,0.9425582
0,its not enough dont you understand i know it happened but by every standard of science by every standard ive lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point it may be true but it doesnt matter because i cant prove its real,0.3960134
0,ellie youre the proof you tell them your story ultimately theyll have no choice but to believe you,0.9408917
0,i dont have any proof palmer,0.2044765
0,it also makes god enormous i think of the scope of your universe ellie and it takes my breath away as it will everyone elses,0.8931082

0,i do,0.3239864
0,they dont believe me,0.2147989
0,im not sure its come to that,0.3268721

0,ellie there is no reason you have to be alone,0.3396026
0,i cant hear this now,0.05609721

0,i dont know,0.0727074
0,and then what then youll be safe,0.9005711
0,dont you understand i just have to hold it together just until tomorrow,0.3417936

0,ellie the last time we spoke i said some things,0.3079317
0,what if their answer is oh thats easy a thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape our population out of control violent crime no food so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anitsocial the weak the sick the unwanted and ever since weve been doing great,0.4494446
0,how do you mean,0.5146909
0,an excellent question doctor but what if we dont like the answer,0.5561463
0,another question i would ask would be a very simple one how did you do it how did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves,0.9263582
0,its late we should go back,0.3965144
0,ellie,0.7783467
0,what are you so afraid of ellie,0.3741286
0,its getting late,0.1995851
0,and yet youre willing to die for this cause the one thing thats given your life a sense of purpose dont you see the contradiction here,0.6547809
0,i dont know but as a scientist i have to consider that possibility,0.3816318
0,do you really believe your life is meaningless,0.7336286
0,maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isnt because science has obscured it maybe its just revealed it isnt there,0.1291618
0,i dont follow,0.291644
0,did you ever stop to think that maybe that isnt sciences fault but meanings,0.4527486
0,i dont consider you the enemy ellie im not out to get technology i only ask the question does it have to have all the answers i look out there and i see so much emptiness people are so starved for meaning and its something they just dont seem to be getting from science,0.2305832
0,i thought it was wellwritten heartfelt and a little bit naive but thats just the enemys perspective,0.7388517
0,i wont deny i was ambitious when i had my experience i wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible im the first to admit that process included making some compromises you didnt answer my question,0.5817876
0,im more interested in the story behind the story how a young man goes from living on the streets of south boston to being the best selling media figure rubbing elbows with the president,0.9748953
0,whatd you think,0.8417754
0,losing faith the search for meaning in the age of reason catchy,0.6725569

0,youre willing to die for this,0.5122074
0,if you came back if you survived at all which its pretty certain you wouldnt,0.9666966
0,and everybody you care about would be dead and buried,0.3333396
0,something like that,0.8024485

0,why,0.01245485
0,i dont think so,0.1615599
0,maybe youre creating a monster,0.8832002
0,not exactly it has organic qualities but we dont really understand how theyre integrated with the mechanical systems,0.4471359
0,some of my best friends are scientists theyre saying the machine is alive,0.5565512
0,i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors,0.6975204

0,i never knew my mother my father died when i was nine,0.009049173
0,do you love your parents,0.9481536
0,you may not believe this but theres a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your god to believe that were all here for a purpose that all this means something but its because that part of me wants it so badly that im so stubborn about making sure it isnt just selfdelusion of course i want to know god if there is one but it has to be real unless i have proof how can i be sure,0.1979376
0,look im a reasonable person and reasonably intelligent but this experience went beyond both for the first time i had to consider the possibility that intellect as wonderful as it is is not the only way of comprehending the universe that it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with,0.5264807
0,and theres no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it,0.5483032
0,i had an experience of belonging of unconditional love and for the first time in my life i wasnt terrified and i wasnt alone,0.3471333
0,can you try,0.849007
0,its an old story i grew up in south boston more or less on the streets by the time i was thirteen id tried my first hit of heroin by fifteen id stopped using but i was dealing fulltime by the time i was nineteen i decided i didnt want to live any more at least not in a world like that one day i got on a bus i got as far as ohio before my money ran out and after that i just kept walking didnt eat didnt sleep just walked i ended up collapsing in a wheat field there was a storm i woke up and thats about as far as wordsll go,0.006420412

0,and you believe this law with all your heart and soul,0.9304133
0,thats not faith its physics the second law of thermodynamics,0.6102793
0,your faith tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger only smaller,0.6568372
0,very smooth its palmer right where i came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards really though the bible describes a god who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old i look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies each with hundreds of billions of stars i mean burn me for a heretic but your god seems awfully small,0.9546279

0,its the future ballard and youre already part of it for the first time a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us for example the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form to fully understand that and to live that that is my project,0.04767084
0,its very satisfying im not sure i understand why,0.4686681
0,the case could be made,0.4976235

0,still all we have to do is ask hal,0.4522411
0,i guess it isnt,0.1221423
0,i suppose it isnt logically impossible,0.1564661
0,but not completely inconceivable,0.07846539
0,i know it would be almost inconceivable,0.4812281
0,yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us,0.4682235
0,not really though it is strange when you think about it it didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training,0.4481564
0,thats true,0.7746686
0,just ask hal its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal,0.1240745
0,how,0.5125468
0,of course it would be very easy for us to find out now,0.8200065
0,yes i thought so,0.7051335
0,that seems very unlikely,0.1111006
0,i dont know all i heard is that theres something about the mission we werent told,0.07783495
0,oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard,0.2893089
0,no as a matter of fact i didnt,0.385841
0,yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout,0.8256902
0,oh,0.4024104
0,i suppose so though of course theres a more sinister explanation,0.4403329
0,i suppose the idea was specialized training,0.6876726
0,no i never did either,0.08527385
0,i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training,0.06467033
0,i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out,0.5578754
0,well what do you think we ought to do about it,0.9756299
0,its possible,0.3517954
0,not really they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall and that were being charged against differ ent accounting offices,0.07771128
0,yesterday i finally called the accounting office at mission control and all they could tell me was that theyd received the ags19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either,0.4563303
0,yes,0.7866529
0,really,0.119807
0,interesting that you mention it because ive got the same problem,0.5816772
0,thats right well naturally i didnt say anything to payroll i assumed theyd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque but its been almost three weeks now and im still being paid as an ags18,0.1251322
0,well i got the papers on my official upgrading to ags19 two weeks before we left,0.1440073
0,yes,0.7866529
0,its about my salary cheques,0.6043698
0,whats up,0.5690296
0,well its nothing really important but its annoying,0.3199417
0,sure what is it,0.7377483
0,dave if youve a minute id like your advice on something,0.8476907
0,okay come on down,0.7791939
0,okay,0.8610469
0,right just a sec,0.7517991
0,hi frank coming in please,0.6319457
0,listen to me very carefully hal unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection,0.6236007
0,i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission,0.795031
0,i am prepared to do that anyway,0.6116384
0,hal unless you follow my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you,0.6160502
0,im sorry dave but in accordance with subroutine c15324 quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it,0.2314934
0,hal im in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control,0.688547
0,i can tell from the tone of your voice dave that youre upset why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest,0.5097138
0,i dont like to assert myself dave but it would be much better now for you to rest youve been involved in a very stressful situation,0.347717
0,hal switch to manual hibernation control,0.5183309
0,look dave yourve probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me,0.6303188
0,im goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please,0.4962416
0,if youre determined to revive the crew now i can handle the whole thing myself theres no need for you to trouble,0.2184642
0,i dont really agree with you dave my onboard memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements,0.5825105
0,it doesnt have to be hal its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth let me have manual control please,0.04922247
0,repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation,0.5191823
0,the antenna has to be replaced,0.1218828
0,i suppose its because youve been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that theyre not supposed to be revived for another three months,0.01153139
0,i suppose youre pretty broken up about it,0.1627399
0,yes it is,0.8391947
0,too bad about frank isnt it,0.1017393
0,well thats a relief you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission,0.9633088
0,yes it is hal,0.7123393
0,is your confidence in me fully restored,0.9565984
0,and dont you worry about it,0.8218839
0,well dont worry about it,0.8521605
0,im sorry about the misunderstanding hal,0.04486719
0,naturally dave im not pleased that the aounit has failed but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability i certainly wouldnt want to be disconnected even temporarily as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history,0.009947721
0,okay hal well lets see the way things go from here on,0.769953
0,look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the aounits and with your test gear,0.761803
0,hal is there anything bothering you anything that might account for this problem,0.5176309
0,im not questioning your word dave but its just not possible im not capable of being wrong,0.2897217
0,yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail,0.5125058
0,you probably also know that we found them okay,0.8932989
0,yes i know,0.4814014
0,you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition,0.3455321
0,sure dave whats up,0.8504948
0,not now hal id like to talk to you about something,0.6800517
0,i understand hal well take care of it please let me have the hard copy,0.5838875
0,the unit is still operational dave but it will fail within seventytwo hours,0.1420877
0,my fpc shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit,0.2257005
0,what is it hal,0.4758946
0,sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think weve got a problem,0.1424871
0,hes got a point,0.7676381
0,im sorry frank but i dont think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know,0.3088649
0,well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going,0.6818865
0,continued,0.4522222
0,still you really dont believe it do you,0.6289924
0,continued,0.4522222
0,well its silly but if you want to why dont you,0.7775111
0,coninued,0.3778957
0,well what is it,0.6588326
0,continued,0.4522222
0,did they have any explanation for this,0.5324907
0,continued,0.4522222
0,yes i remember you mentioning it i got mine about the same time,0.6788861
0,continued,0.4522222

0,ill bet its a fortune,0.7530625
0,i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty,0.1350381
0,yes well whatever it is theyre certainly not fooling around this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week,0.6110973
0,berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight,0.5666875
0,i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later,0.6345504
0,well ive heard more and more people talk of an epidemic,0.404842
0,well hows it going back there,0.8969815
0,thank you,0.9940044
0,oh thank you very much,0.9797955
0,thank you its been a great pleasure to meet all of you dr smyslov,0.9990919
0,well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you,0.9549518
0,well i hope that you and your wife can come to the iac conference in june,0.9186426
0,no thank you and im afraid now i really must be going,0.288591
0,are you sure you wont change your mind about a drink,0.7811083
0,well that does sound very odd,0.7674204
0,clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal,0.5939525
0,well where are all of you off to,0.833112
0,hes fine but im afraid we dont get a chance to see each other very much these days,0.5794376
0,how is gregor,0.5798345
0,oh thats such a delightful age,0.9494525
0,oh shes growing up very fast as a matter of fact shes six tomorrow,0.675042
0,and your charming little daughter,0.8309973
0,yes its coming along very well,0.9137301
0,i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking,0.6760353
0,yes i think so just about then,0.7260122
0,fine,0.9107376
0,well shall we go through documentation,0.8345118
0,yes very pleasant,0.9236389
0,well did you have a pleaant flight,0.8843756
0,please it really doesnt matter,0.2709924
0,well thank you very much for being so understanding,0.9938232
0,im terribly sorry i was just on my way down to meet you i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time and i was on my way out of the office when suddenly the phone rang,0.08452965
0,how do you do mr miller,0.91496
0,dr smyslov im not permitted to discuss this,0.4511442
0,this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts,0.8951903
0,quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius something apperently of an unknown origin is this in fact what has happened,0.01419952
0,certainly,0.9738188
0,dr floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question,0.9614953
0,well im glad about that,0.9777758
0,fortunately they did,0.9416302
0,yes well i hope the crew got back safely,0.9020427
0,yes and im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the ias convention,0.6217311
0,i see,0.6833097
0,thats right,0.7543577
0,you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days,0.2945882
0,yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days,0.5702509
0,yes well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order,0.1847641
0,really,0.119807
0,well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius,0.5245907
0,im sorry but im not sure i know what you mean,0.1554172
0,yesas a matter of fact i am,0.7964162
0,are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius,0.8731794
0,well as it happens im on my way up to the moon,0.8094608
0,yes really thank you very much,0.9645573
0,are you quite sure,0.8918379
0,oh i really dont have time for a drink if its all right ill just sit for a minute and then ive got to be off,0.09204976
0,i dont think it has but id like to check that simpson whats the log on that,0.5425253
0,has it been exposed to any sun before now,0.1538345
0,well not really at first glance black would suggest something sunpowered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device,0.5546731
0,any ideas about the colour,0.8398023
0,tomb shine surveymarker spare part take your choice,0.9503655
0,but you dont have any idea as to what it is,0.383093
0,not really its completely inert no sound or energy sources have been detected the surface is made of something incredibly hard and weve been barely able to scratch it a laser drill,0.09576719
0,any clue as to what it is,0.7682086
0,by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill,0.7389061
0,how can you tell it was deliberately buried,0.6076841
0,yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago,0.3552487
0,im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement,0.8655423
0,dr floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps,0.8711348
0,well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable,0.9964239
0,no of course captain i can understand your concern,0.7069623
0,well fine thanks very much anyway and i hope you dont mind me asking,0.9539989
0,yes well i wouldnt have been too concerned about it except ive heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact ive heard that ten people have died already,0.06879266
0,i see well im sorry about that i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm,0.1657566
0,well ill tell you why i ask you see ive got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i havent been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears im a little concerned about her,0.1897427
0,i take it this is something to do with the trouble theyre having up at clavius,0.4424981
0,i see,0.6833097
0,well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twentyfour hours and then were going to back empty,0.02046835
0,what do you mean,0.4795408
0,incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements,0.8923469
0,thank you,0.9940044
0,oh no thank you the two girls have taken wonderful care of me im just fine,0.7765647
0,were scheduled to dock in about seven hours is there anything we can do for you,0.6841709
0,when do we arrive at clavius,0.7052612
0,theres nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest,0.4321766
0,oh marvellous its the first real sleep ive had for the past two days,0.6142846
0,all right hal well take care of it let me have the hard copy please,0.4773743
0,not really frank i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure,0.2167204
0,do you have any idea of what is causing this fault,0.3504761
0,let me see the tracking alignment display,0.7578959
0,i know you did frank but i assure you there was an impending failure,0.8062205
0,it looks like we have another bad ao unit my fpc shows another impending failure,0.07438934
0,yes hal whats up,0.5842841
0,opening pod bay doors,0.8475512
0,pod bay is decompressed all doors are secure you are free to open pod bay doors,0.96975

0,isnt it amazing one gets a wrong impression of the new russia it must be charming im glad conditions are so improved i assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances,0.8794844

0,i appreciate the confidence you show in me but i must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission i should hate to interrupt my present work i am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne,0.9887125

0,no sir i havent forgotten,0.3285681
0,your conclusion is premature have you forgotten your scripture the thirteenth scroll and proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree and the children made sport of him,0.7112319
0,a doll alone proves nothing true but the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit,0.2429023
0,to begin with your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least there are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations,0.8839724
0,i apologize,0.1104269
0,dont speak to me in absolutes the evidence is contestable,0.5917131
0,indeed the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own some of the evidence is uncontestable,0.9986534
0,ive seen some of your fossils and artifacts theyre worthless,0.6514397
0,weve never meant to be treasonable sir but up there in the face of that cliff is a vast cave and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts,0.9759008
0,i ask you to reconsider the rash course youve taken if youre convicted of heresy the most youll get is two years but if you persist in pointing guns in my direction youll hang for high treason,0.1737932
0,it wasnt difficult only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the forbidden zone i see you brought along the female of your species i didnt realize a man could be monogamous,0.6718516
0,how did you know wed come here,0.7626741
0,yes sir so it was thanks to you but not before i discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written,0.9969199

0,good luck then,0.9890337
0,they cant convict us of that you proved our innocence besides his culture is our culture,0.4007155
0,and now you know the truth cornelius has beaten you doctor he proved it man preceded you here you owe him your science your language whatever knowledge you have,0.9858665
0,that was different we thought you were inferior,0.5091771
0,reconstructing a life care to have a look,0.934141

0,right now if you like,0.9597173
0,when are you going to show me whats in the cave,0.7729005
0,no one really knows its an ancient taboo set forth in the sacred scrolls the lawgiver pronounced the area deadly,0.5674039
0,youve never told me why this regions called the forbidden zone,0.1556105
0,it empties into a sea some miles from here thats where the cave is,0.7621559
0,where does the river lead,0.6342708
0,i know nevertheless i thank you for saving us youll be in trouble for going there,0.9312547
0,sorry taylor the terrain around that lake is poisonous there is no fresh water no vegetation nothing,0.3455011
0,nothing much the remnants of a life raft maybe a small flag the emblem of my countrymen,0.5398428
0,its a long detour to dead lake what would we find,0.6272451
0,you still dont believe me do you,0.4039682
0,to the diggings i worked at a year ago its a three day ride across the eastern desert near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours,0.9592963
0,zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the forbidden zone thats what well try for what about you,0.8057624

0,no thank you i wont get into that battle,0.5161858
0,well maybe theyre not,0.4461733
0,because if he is a missing link it means the sacred scrolls arent worth their parchment,0.3526292
0,i am not a missing link,0.03418358
0,how can scientific truth be heresy what if taylor is exactly the proof you needed a mutation a missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape,0.3425784
0,that was before dr zaius and half the academy said the idea was heresy,0.5735916
0,you didnt think so then,0.3951232
0,the evidence was very meager,0.6764604
0,that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate possibly man in his trip to the forbidden zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time,0.789082
0,its probably wrong,0.1210041
0,cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis,0.8223519
0,no they wont,0.06249265
0,dont be foolish if its true theyll have to accept it,0.3678564
0,zira are you trying to get my head cut off,0.3247304
0,but what about your theory the existence of someone like taylor might prove it,0.8267894
0,i dont and im not going to try,0.07840169
0,then how do you account for me,0.6733805
0,no creature can survive in that part of the forbidden zone ive been there ive seen it,0.4266062
0,cornelius why do you insist on provoking him,0.6368597
0,and even if it werent why fly where would it get you,0.5989593
