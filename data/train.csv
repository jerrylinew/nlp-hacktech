0,how do you do that
0,thats all taken care of you see mr gittes either you bring the water to la or you bring la to the water
0,theres going to be some irate citizens when they find out theyre paying for water theyre not getting
0,no mr gittes thats what i am doing with the valley the bond issue passes tuesday therell be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir im doing it
0,and thats what you were going to do in the valley
0,thats where life begins marshes sloughs tidepools he was fascinated by them you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs youd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty he made this city
0,havent the faintest idea
0,hollie was always fond of tidepools you know what he used to say about them
0,the coroners report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs

0,well shes an extremely jealous person i didnt want her to find out about the girl
0,if you want to hire me i still have to know what you and mulwray were arguing about
0,hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune we were a lot closer than evelyn realized
0,i didnt realize you and hollis were so fond of each other
0,just find the girl mr gittes i think she is frightened and i happen to know hollis was fond of her id like to help her if i can

0,who said that gary cooper james stewart henry fonda huh
0,do like the soldier toto go away this land is cursed when youre here every day you feel like youre at the center of the universe it seems like nothing ever changes then you go away one year twoand when you come back everythings different the thread has broken you dont find those you were looking for your things no longer exist isnt that the caseyouve got to go away a long time for many many years before coming back and finding your people again the land where you were bornbut not now its impossible now youre blinder than i am
0,now i understand why the soldier went away just before the end thats right just one more night and the princess would have been his but she also could not have kept her promise andthat would have been terrible he would have died from it so instead for ninetynine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him
0,listen to this onethe commander says to the sergeant you remember that windmill that used to be there yes sir i remember the mills gone but the winds still there you remember the story of the soldier and the princess
0,it was probably meant to be like this each of us has a star to follow so now what are you thinking of doing
0,no and nobody knows where she is
0,did you ever see her again
0,toto sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing so its better to shut up its hot in here toto take me to the beach
0,they tell me you never go out never talk to anybody why
0,you re thinneryou can tell youve not been treated well
0,no nobody came
0,im here take it easy take it easy sit down sit down did she come
0,but whered you go toto
0,you were expecting her huh its a nasty business waiting by yourself in company its better nothen ill leave
0,no alfredo i was coming to help you
0,you werent expecting me
0,could bebut i dont like this business it smells fishy to me
0,just so alfredo there isnt any and if you buy a television set you can watch it at home without any fuss
0,toto are you pulling my leg or something how is it possible to see this television without film
0,no you mean right at the end alfredo thats right toto right at the end and dont ask me what it means if you figure it out let me know
0,i want to make you happy toto im going to tell you a story once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm basta one of the guards saw the kings daughter she was the loveliest of all and he immediately fell in love with her but what could a poor soldier do compared with a kings daughterone day he managed to meet her and told her he couldnt live without her the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony then in the end ill be yours christ the soldier ran off there and waited one day two days ten twentyevery night she looked out of her window but he never budged come rain wind snow never budged the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldnt hold them back he didnt even have the strength to sleep any more the princess kept watchand on the ninetyninth night the soldier got up picked up his chair and left
0,you see it s like i say you always have an answer for everything
0,heeey totooooo dont get pissed off with me now come here i dont know where the fuck i have to go and the next time be careful how you talk not to take credit away from the lord but if i had created the world in all modesty certain things would have come out better but unfortunately such was not the case
0,stop it ive had enough of your sermons you act as if you created the world
0,dont think about it toto dont even try with feelings theres nothing to understand
0,but why there must be some way to make her understand
0,i told you the blueeyed ones are the most difficult
0,theyre not my words john wayne said it in shepherd of the hills
0,what you say is wonderful but sad
0,eh lovewhat a mystery i understand you totothe ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful whatever you do you cant make friends with them eh theres nothing to be done about it the heavier a man is the deeper his footprints and if hes in love he suffers because he knows hes up a oneway street because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants
0,whats she like whats she like
0,yes its a girl i saw at the station
0,is there a womantell me the truth there is a woman
0,nothing theres nothing its all out of focus

0,yes
0,ive shown it so many times i know it by heart the first time i showed it in 1940 was the sunday my first wife died they kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldnt have to close down the movie house i only found out that night after the last show those are things you never forget so toto how are these home movies going

0,do we stand for the same things that the chronicle stands for mr bernstein
0,sure theyre like anybody else they got work to do they do it only they happen to be the best men in the business
0,mr bernstein these men who are now with the enquirer who were with the chronicle until yesterday werent they just as devoted to the chronicle kind of paper as they are now to our kind of paper
0,whats the matter
0,yes
0,isnt it wonderful such a party
0,certainly not
0,do you mr leland
0,that looks pretty nice
0,sixtytwo thousand
0,you just made the paper over four times today mr kane thats all
0,charlie
0,wasted
0,its three hours and fifty minutes late but we did it
0,well be on the street soon charlie another ten minutes
0,who said anything about brooms
0,im not guaranteeing a thing mr bernstein you people work too fast for me talk about new brooms
0,but mr kane i meant
0,it is accepted mr carter with assurances of my deepest regard
0,ive been a newspaperman my whole life and i dont intend if its your intention that i should continue to be harassed by this this i warn you mr kane it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly but i would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted
0,thatll be all today mr carter youve been most understanding good day mr carter
0,but mr kane
0,really mr kane i cant see the function of a respectable newspaper
0,thats the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on mr carter right now i wish youd send your best man up to see mr silverstone have him tell mr silverstone if he doesnt produce his wife at once the enquirer will have him arrested have him tell mr silverstone hes a detective from the central office if mr silverstone asks to see his badge your man is to get indignant and call mr silverstone an anarchist loudly so that the neighbors can hear
0,its not our function to report the gossip of housewives if we were interested in that kind of thing mr kane we could fill the paper twice over daily
0,the chronicle doesnt say shes murdered mr carter it says the neighbors are getting suspicious
0,as a matter of fact we sent a man to the silverstone home yesterday afternoon our man even arrived before the chronicle reporter and theres no proof that the woman was murdered or even that shes dead
0,if the headline is big enough it makes the new big enough the murder of mrs harry silverstone
0,there is no news big enough
0,im still hungry brad lets go to rectors and get something decent the chronicle has a twocolumn headline mr carter why havent we
0,because were running a newspaper mr kane not a scandal sheet
0,im not criticizing mr carter but heres what i mean theres a front page story in the chronicle and a picture of a woman in brooklyn who is missing probably murdered a mrs harry silverstone why didnt the enquirer have that this morning
0,thats one of the things i think must be changed mr carter the news goes on for twentyfour hours a day
0,but a morning newspaper mr kane after all were practically closed twelve hours a day except for the business offices
0,im going to live right here as long as i have to
0,my little sanctum is at your disposal but i dont think i understand

0,thank you i cant imagine how mrs kane came to make such a silly mistake the sedative dr wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle i suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her
0,the nurse has complete instructions but if you care to talk to me at any time i should be only too glad i shall be here in the morning
0,id rather mr kane withdrew without having to get the story published not that i care about him but id be better off that way and so would you mrs kane
0,you dont have to show me anything mr rogers i believe you
0,the story about him and miss alexander mrs kane
0,what story mr rogers
0,i think i understand mr rogers but i wonder if

0,emily youre being a little unfair you know what i think of charles behavior about your personal lives
0,why should anyone vote for him hes made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them children to be told one thing one day something else the next as the whim seizes him and theyre supposed to be grateful and love and adore him because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars

0,youve made your point perfectly clear mr kane good day
0,im much obliged mr president for your concern about me however i happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the united states and i say that if this lease goes through the property of the people of the united states goes into the hands of
0,i understand that you have political ambitions unfortunately you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own
0,thanks
0,i know the facts mr kane and i happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean youre a man of great talents mr kane
0,its the only vein i know i tell the facts the way i see them and any man that knows that facts
0,i must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein mr kane
0,im not suggesting anything mr president ive come here to tell you that unless some action is taken promptly and you are the only one who can take it the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks
0,it is the unanimous opinion of my cabinent in which i concur that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the governement and the people you are not i hope suggesting that these interests are not indentical
0,you cant
0,mr kane how can i persuade you
0,if youre interested in what people say signor matisti i may be able to enlighten you a bit the newspapers for instance im an authority on what the papers will say signor matisti because i own eight of them between here and san francisco its all right dear signor matisti is going to listen to reason arent you maestro
0,but it is impossible i will be the laughingstock of the musical world people will say
0,your job isnt to give mrs kane your opinion of her talents youre supposed to train her voice nothing more
0,impossible impossible
0,youre right we did lose a million dollars last year
0,i happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday charles could i not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise this enquirer that is costing you one million dollars a year
0,on the other hand i am the publisher of the enquirer as such it is my duty ill let you in on a little secret it is also my pleasure to see to it that decent hardworking people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money mad pirates because god help them they have no one to look after their interests ill let you in on another little secret mr thatcher i think im the man to do it you see i have money and property
0,charles my time is too valuable for me
0,as charles foster kane who has 			eighty two thousand six hundred and thirtyone shares of metropolitan transfer you see i do have a rough idea of my holdings i sympathize with you charles foster kane is a dangerous scoundrel his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him you may if you can form such a committee put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars
0,the trouble is mr thatcher you dont realize youre talking to two people
0,theyre all part of your general attack your senseless attack on everything and everybody whos got more than ten cents in his pocket theyre
0,mr thatcher isnt everything ive been saying in the enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true
0,wont you step into my office mr thatcher
0,i came to see you charles about your about the enquirers campaign against the metropolitan transfer company

0,hello charlie i didnt know we were speaking
0,hello brad
0,i couldnt possibly live on as little as that charlie well let the salary stay where it is
0,well youve been getting a pretty low salary here in new york it seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our chicago paper should get what hes worth
0,yes
0,you still want to be transferred to the other paper
0,hey brad ive been analyzed an awful lot tonight lets have another brandy
0,i know you will
0,she can leave me as a matter of fact ive already left her dont worry brad ill live
0,its simpler than that brad a society girl cant stand the gaff thats all other things are important to her social position what theyre saying on the front porches at southampton is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner
0,you want love on your own terms dont you charlie love according to your own rules and if anything goes wrong and youre hurt then the game stops and youve got to be soothed and nursed no matter what else is happening and no matter who else is hurt
0,nothing if she dosent love me
0,thats all right what are you going to do about emily
0,youre not going to like it in chicago they wind comes howling in from the lake and theres practically no opera season at all and the lord only knows whether theyve ever heard of lobster newburg
0,yes now will you let me go to chicago
0,are you finished
0,you talk about the people of the united states as though they belonged to you when you find out they dont think they are youll lose interest you talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty remember the working man you used to defend him quite a good deal well hes turning into something called organized labor and you dont like that at all and listen when your precious underprivileged really get together thats going to add up to something bigger than than your privilege and then i dont know what youll do sail away to a desert island probably and lord it over the monkeys
0,you almost convince me im just drunk enough to tell you the truth i have to be a little drunk for that because im a coward you know that thats why you keep me around you only associate with your inferiors charlie i guess thats why you ran away from emily because you cant stand the company of your equals you dont like to admit they exist the other big people in your world are dead i told you that
0,the personal note is all there is to it its all there ever is to it its all there every is to anything stupidity in our government complacency and selfsatisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong you cant fight those things impersonally theyre not impersonal crimes against people theyre being done by actual persons with actual names and positions and the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue brad that you debate and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers
0,theres no reason why this this savage personal note
0,you might have made the whole thing less personal
0,do you think the enquirer shouldnt have campaigned against the oil leases
0,she hasnt any friends left sine you started this oil business and she never sees you
0,why is she leaving me
0,sure i am she wants full custody of the child no matter what happens if you wont agree to that shell apply for a divorce regardless of the presidents wishes i cant tell her shes wrong because she isnt wrong
0,brad you are drunk
0,emilys going south next week with the child as far as anybodys to know its a holiday when they get back
0,she was going to leave you anyway
0,i dont think so brad weve just had word that the president is out of danger it seems i didnt kill him after all
0,shes going to leave you
0,all right
0,no that wont help besides you never get drunk i wanted to talk about you and emily
0,ill tell you what ill do brad ill get drunk too maybe thatll help
0,i want to be transferred to the new paper youve been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to thats not what i wanted to talk about
0,why brad
0,charlie its just no go we cant agree anymore i wish youd let me go to chicago
0,thats just a little promotion scheme nobody expects you mike will you try and get mr leland some coffee
0,first of all i will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the enquirer
0,ill get you some coffee
0,im drunk
0,whats wrong brad
0,first of all
0,go ahead
0,id like to talk to you about that
0,ive got to think of emily
0,what
0,i dont have to i run a newspaper with half a million readers and theyre getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast i cant help that besides they all know im married to his niece ive got to think of her
0,charlie now youre not making sense
0,what lesson not to expose fraud when i see it not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property run it the way i said reilly this afternoon a great man was assassinated
0,there are the people of the united states and they are blaming you oh i know it doesnt make any sense but at least you can learn a lesson from it
0,look out that window
0,oil belonging to the people of the united states was leased out for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks nobody can blame me because
0,charlie
0,theyre true everything i said witholding that veto was treason
0,youve said a lot of things about the president in the last few months
0,i said treason was a capital offense punishable by death
0,and that copy of the enquirer said the president should be killed
0,because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the enquirer in his pocket
0,yesterday morning you called the president a traitor what do you think that crowd is doing down there they think you murdered him
0,what do you mean by that
0,why not well nobodys a great man in your estimation until hes dead
0,why not
0,do you think youre the one who should call him a great man
0,yes
0,charlie
0,take dictation front page editorial this afternoon a great man was assassinated he was the president of the united states
0,youre wrong it does make a difference to you rectors brad come to think of it i dont blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent you wont miss anything it isnt much of a war besides they tell me there isnt a decent restaurant on the whole island
0,it doesnt make any difference about me but one of these days youre going to find out that all this charm of yours wont be enough
0,yes
0,charlie
0,you start tomorrow night richard carl in the spring chicken ill get us some girls you get tickets a drama critic gets them free you know rectors at seven
0,id like that
0,you dont want to be a war correspondent how about being a dramatic critic
0,good
0,i mean ive got a job for you
0,yes
0,say brad ive got an idea
0,and i do it because they do it and they do it its a vicious circle isnt it im going over to georgies brad you know georgie dont you
0,they do it only because you do
0,how would the enquirer look with no news about this nonexistent war with benton pulitzer and heart devoting twenty columns a day to it
0,charles i tell you there is no war theres a condition that should be remedied but between that and a
0,all right brad all right you dont have to be a war correspondent unless you want to id want to hello georgie
0,but there is no front charlie theres a very doubtful civil war besides i dont want the job
0,itll be our first foreign war in fifty years brad well cover it the way the hickville gazette covers the church social the names of everybody there what they wore what they ate who won the prizes who gave the prizes i tell you brad i envy you by bradford leland the enquirers special correspondent at the front im almost tempted
0,our readers are anyway i dont know about the rest of the country
0,well gentlemen are we going to war
0,its a good idea for a newspaper four hundred sixy thousand
0,the chronicle is a good newspaper
0,people are going to know whos responsible and theyre going to get the news the true news quickly and simply and entertainingly and no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news
0,thats the second sentence youve started with i
0,whatre you going to do charlie
0,ive changed the front page a little mr bernstein thats not enough theres something ive got to get into this paper besides pictures and print ive got to make the new york enquirer as important to new york as the gas in that light
0,a wasted day
0,its been a tough day
0,tired
0,what makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid something inflexible that people are supposed to pay two cents for
0,poor mr carter
0,i think its beginning to dawn on mr rogers that i mean what i say with mr rogers out of the way reilly i think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state well mr bernstein
0,rogers isnt even pretending he isnt just scared anymore hes sick frank norris told me last night he hasnt known rogers to be that worried in twentyfive years
0,it does seem too good to be true doesnt it mr bernstein
0,it was for twentyfive thousand dollars
0,oh yes the bonus
0,you made it out to him last week after he left for chicago
0,what check
0,mr leland sent back that check

0,hey nurse
0,sure mr leland ill be glad to
0,on your way out stop at a cigar store will you and send me up a couple of cigars
0,sure
0,i dont know he was disappointed in the world so he built one of his own an absolute monarchy it was something bigger than an opera house anyway nurse say ill tell you one thing you can do for me young fellow
0,that must have been love
0,i guess maybe im not as hard to see through as i think anyway i never even answered his letter maybe i should have i guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years he hadnt finished it when she left him he never finished it he never finished anything of course he built it for her
0,yes
0,well thats about all there is and im getting chills hey nurse five years ago he wrote from that place of his down south you know shangrila el dorado sloppy joes whats the name of that place you know all right xanadu i knew what it was all the time you caught on didnt you
0,he married for love thats why he did everything thats why he went into politics it seems we werent enough he wanted all the voters to love him too all he really wanted out of life was love thats charlies story its the story of how he lost it you see he just didnt have any to give he loved charlie kane of course very dearly and his mother i guess he always loved her as for emily well all i can tell you is emilys story as she told it to me which probably isnt fair theres supposed to be two sides to every story and i guess there are i guess theres more than two sides
0,was he in love
0,brief marriage ten years
0,i am in receipt of your favor of yesterday i beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that mrs whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of charles foster kane she has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget with assurances of the highest esteem
0,he knows the first mrs kane socially thats the answer we got
0,oh yes i know about mr rawlston
0,rawlston is my boss
0,david grobleski davis my dear rawlston

0,maybe you could remember something that
0,never mind bernstein told you about the first days at the office didnt he well charlie was a bad newspaper man even then he entertained his readers but he never told them the truth
0,sorry mr leland
0,you dont happen to have a cigar do you ive got a young physician must remember to ask to see his license the odds are a hundred to one he hasnt got one who thinks im going to stop smoking i changed the subject didnt i dear dear what a disagreeable old man ive become you want to know what i think of charlie kane well i suppose he has some private sort of greatness but he kept it to himself he never gave himself away he never gave anything away he just left you a tip he had a generous mind i dont suppose anybody ever had so many opinions that was because he had the power to express them and charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it but he didnt believe in anything except charlie kane he never had a conviction in his life i guess he died without one that must have been pretty unpleasant of course a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death but we do know what were leaving we believe in something youre absolutely sure you havent got a cigar
0,mr leland you were

0,bunch of savages in this town hey caitlins in the back you might want to see if shes okay shes been back there a long time
0,who eats cock
0,ill read the book
0,all right but youre missing out chicks with dicks
0,i might be leaving early to go out with caitlin in which case youll have to close the store tonight
0,you want me to bring the vcr over here so we can watch this
0,in my absence try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns
0,youre a snake
0,no dont bring it up i dont want to think about that now let me enjoy this hour of bliss ill think about all of that later in the meantime nobody mentions the v word
0,hey what about veronica
0,this is my way of spitting water at life
0,what happened to title dictates behavior
0,watch the store while i go home and change
0,i feel so ineffectual is there anything i can do for you
0,she went home shes getting ready and were going out
0,wow youve had quite an evening
0,im not
0,youre kidding
0,shes not going to marry that guy she went home to tell her mother
0,what did she say
0,im not she just left
0,now i know youre lying
0,no im happy because caitlin came to see me
0,youre happy to get a fine
0,im happy
0,youre happy
0,because im happy
0,then why arent you like screaming at me right now
0,i swear i couldnt make this kind of hell up
0,youre lying
0,because im here
0,then how come you got the fine
0,as opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here
0,holy shit that girl
0,little girl maybe five years old
0,really
0,i dont you did
0,i thought you never sold cigarettes to kids
0,living proof
0,i didnt think they even enforced this
0,youre bullshitting
0,five hundred dollars
0,no way
0,i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor
0,i like to expand my horizons
0,and this is what you rented
0,hermaphroditic porn starlets with both organs you should see the box beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame
0,whatd you rent best of both worlds
0,get to work
0,i know im your hero
0,please get the hell out of here
0,i like to think im a master of my own destiny
0,youre a danger to both the dead and the living
0,if title dictated my behavior as a clerk serving the public i wouldnt be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy but i did so my point is that people dictate their own behavior hence even though im a clerk in this video store i choose to go rent videos at big choice agreed
0,what
0,and two to make a point title does not dictate behavior
0,jesus
0,two reasons one i hate when the people cant shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines
0,what the fuck did you do that for
0,not yet
0,thats stretching it youre not being asked to slay children or anything
0,exactly
0,the reasons you wont let me borrow your car is because i have a title and a job description and im supposed to follow it right
0,what
0,so your argument is that title dictates behavior
0,its going to have to do for now considering that its my car thats up for request can i help you
0,you know what i dont think i care for your rationale
0,theres a difference those were obligations obligations that could not have been met at any later date now renting videosthats just gratuitous not to mention illogical considering you work in a video store
0,i see so playing hockey and attending wakesthese practices are standard operating procedure
0,we are employees of quick stop convenience and rst video respectively as such we have certain responsibilities whichthough it may seem cruel and unusualdoes include manning our posts until closing
0,if you must
0,may i be blunt with you
0,let me borrow your car
0,can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time
0,you work in a video store
0,whats that for
0,you want to rent a movie
0,i want to rent a movie
0,why should i loan you my car
0,fine just lend me your car
0,i dont want to talk to you
0,let me borrow your car
0,just go go open the video store
0,so theyll put her back in its not like its gonna matter if she breaks something
0,her fucking body fell out
0,so the casket fell over big deal
0,does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose
0,i was just leaning on it it was an accident

0,im telling you it wasnt my fault
0,i cant fucking believe you
0,nobodys there its four oclock on a saturday how many people ever come to the store at four on a saturday
0,i cant help it at least when we were playing hockey outside i could see if anyone wanted to go in

0,an embarrassing way to die
0,an embolism in a pool
0,twentytwo same as us
0,she was pretty young hunhh
0,thanks for putting me in a tough spot youre a good friend

0,but i love gatherings isnt it ironic
0,you hate people
0,im not missing whats probably going to be the social event of the season

0,why not
0,no
0,all of them
0,which ones
0,you know who i can do without i could do without the people in the video store
0,the women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date as if somewherebeyond all the other gallonsis a container of milk that wont go bad for like a decade
0,the milkmaids
0,the milkmaids
0,lets hear it
0,its not really anyone per se its more of separate groupings
0,how can you lie like that why dont you vent vent your frustration come on who pisses you off
0,there arent
0,liar tell me there arent customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis
0,what for they dont bother me if i dont bother them
0,you gotta loosen up my friend youd feel a hell of a lot better if youd rip into the occasional customer
0,im gonna hear it tomorrow
0,who cares that ladys an asshole everybody that comes in here is way too uptight this job would be great if it wasnt for the fucking customers
0,why do you do things like that you know shes going to come back and tell the boss
0,the jizzmoppers job is to clean up the booths afterward because practically everybody shoots a load against the window and i dont know if you know or not but cum leaves streaks if you dont clean it right away
0,can we talk about this later
0,think of the weirdest craziest shit youd like to see chicks do these chicks do it all they insert things into any opening in their body any opening hes led a very sheltered life
0,what kind of show
0,oh its great you step into this little booth and theres this window between you and this naked woman and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks
0,i guess not
0,nudie booth youve never been in a nudie booth
0,nudie booth
0,hes the guy in those nudiebooth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off
0,whats a jizzmopper
0,you know how much money the average jizzmopper make per hour
0,did you ever notice all the prices end in nine damn thats eerie
0,ill give him five more minutes then im calling the cops i dont need this man im not even supposed to be here today
0,its not like you laid the eggs yourself
0,he said it was important to have standards he said nobody has pride anymore
0,what did he say
0,i told him that and he yelled at me
0,why doesnt he just mix and match
0,obviously not look at all the cartons that didnt make the grade
0,the quest isnt going well
0,each egg has to be perfect
0,perfect dozen
0,he said he has to find a perfect dozen
0,whats he looking for
0,this guy is going through all of the eggs look
0,shes in here
0,wait
0,youll never believe what this unruly customer just said
0,all those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed casualties of a war they had nothing to do with all right lookyoure a roofer and some juicy government contract comes your way you got the wife and kids and the twostory in suburbiathis is a government contract which means all sorts of benefits all of a sudden these leftwing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a threemile radius you didnt ask for that you have no personal politics youre just trying to scrape out a living
0,all right so even if independent contractors are working on the death star why are you uneasy with its destruction
0,exactly in order to get it built quickly and quietly theyd hire anybody who could do the job do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main all they know is killing and white uniforms
0,not just imperials is what youre getting at
0,a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer ill bet there were independent contractors working on that thing plumbers aluminum siders roofers
0,so
0,the second time around it wasnt even finished yet they were still under construction
0,and the second time around
0,so when they blew it up no prob evil is punished
0,basically
0,well the thing is the first death star was manned by the imperial army storm troopers dignitariesthe only people onboard were imperials
0,and you figured it out
0,something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it i could never put my finger on itsomething just wasnt right
0,compliments of lando calrissian
0,and the second one was still being built when they blew it up
0,luke blew it up give credit where its due
0,now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it
0,yeah
0,so they build another death star right
0,theres more
0,you know what else i noticed in jedi
0,i think they were catholics
0,the only problem is that at no point in the series did i ever hear leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief
0,more or less
0,hence the empire was a fascist theocracy and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution
0,it would stand to reason yes
0,then wouldnt that logically mean that its a theocracy if the head of the empire is a priest of some sort then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion
0,yeah
0,now hes in charge of the empire the imperial government is under his control and the entire galaxy is under imperial rule
0,i guess
0,well hes like the pope for the dark side of the force hes a holy man a shaman kind of albeit an evil one
0,how do you mean
0,right the emperor now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure yes
0,the emperor
0,all right vaders boss
0,whats that
0,there was something else going on in jedi i never noticed it until today
0,empire had the better ending luke gets his hand cut off and finds out vaders his father han gets frozen and taken away by boba fett it ends on such a down note and thats lifea series of down endings all jedi had was a bunch of muppets
0,blasphemy
0,empire
0,which did you like better jedi or the empire strikes back
0,didnt you hear me caitlin really is getting married
0,return of the jedi
0,me pulling a can off some morons fist
0,you know what i just watched

0,then i think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over
0,i think its safe to say yes
0,caitlins on the same wavelength

0,oh yeah
0,because there was a lot of good in our relationship

0,ill do it on one condition i want to make sure shes okay
0,thats your option ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time in case you didnt know it youre crazy
0,im leaning toward no
0,you made your decision yet
0,well i dont know if
0,im not a violent man mr lowry not by nature anyhow but if you hurt liza in any way ill kill you does that seem honorable
0,it seemed like a possibility what about your intentions are they honorable
0,youre here because you figured i might show up
0,thats ironic because were here to protect her from you
0,you should think of me as liza suttons guardian angel
0,im not sure what you mean
0,i like that a gun to your head and you ask about your partner hes okay may have a headache for a few days are you here with honorable intentions
0,youre welcome wheres my partner
0,thank you
0,i want this box rigged with a beacon
0,its okay im game
0,i dont understand
0,in jerrys safety deposit box
0,you sound so sure
0,walters had nothing to do with your fathers murder
0,not a man ezekiel walters
0,i know the story a federal judge he denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial
0,it was my fathers kept it in his wallet he was murdered
0,you do recognize it then
0,whered you get it
0,so youll believe what i tell you next because i need to find jerry and i dont think i can do that without you
0,if this was a spy novel your next words would be something like i now know too much to live why are you telling me all this
0,belief is immaterial whats important is the truth its been my job to find jerry im very much responsible for him
0,i dont believe you
0,jerry is dangerous jerry has killed
0,im still listening
0,yes thats right
0,these things youre talking about you did them to jerry
0,umy dogu one i intend to put to sleep extrapolate from there
0,a dog
0,and what did i say
0,jerry told me he bit your nose
0,it was it was
0,missionary penance you talk about it like it was a religion
0,me i was a minor missionary a heretic really but where else could a redblooded american boy lie cheat steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the allhighs besides now im trying to pay my penance
0,if i had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it id arrest you right here
0,as in resulting in death we pushed the envelope until it wasnt even an envelope anymore
0,terminal
0,we experimented with hallucinogens we used electro shock to produce a vegetative state we conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation
0,i am impressed we used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card
0,as in ucatcher in the ryeu
0,mk ultra was terminated in 1973 but not the research it was renamed ex catcher
0,ask what you can do for your country that kind of thing
0,a vulgar pop term but yes take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin that was our goal
0,it was mind control umanchurianu ucandidateu kind of stuff right
0,years ago i worked for the cia in the mk ultra program are you familiar with it
0,truthll set you free im listening
0,what im about to tell you is partially documented the freedom of information act saw to that but much more of it isnt for reasons which will soon be regrettably clear im going to share secrets with you repeat any of it and youll simply bestow the title of paranoid upon yourself
0,please sit
0,fine what the hell is going on
0,if youre as impressed to see me as i am to see you youre very impressed indeed hows jerry feeling this morning
0,reeducating trained killers in the ways of polite society making sure the men whove gone over the edge wont hurt anyone that sort of thing
0,brain washing mind control that sort of thing
0,were very specialized
0,i didnt know the cia had psychiatrists
0,only on the football field
0,thats it i went to yale i hope you wont hold that against me
0,the truth shall make you free
0,veritas truth what is it they say about truth
0,a year ago i was leaving work late one night two guys tried to mug me it was horrible jerry came out of nowhere to my rescue then he started coming to see me couldve been a storybook if he wasnt crazy at first i did my beat to avoid him but theres something inside jerry and jerry made me see it uhe made meu usee himu that make sense
0,jerrys visits to your office why do you tolerate them why him
0,excuse me
0,a charming term now uwhy himu
0,honestly i think he has a crush on me
0,uwhy youu
0,im sorry what was the question again
0,heres a fresh one why you your colleague mr wilson says jerry wont speak to anyone else that seems oddly possessive behavior to me
0,youve asked me that one three times
0,and you have no idea where he lives
0,you already asked me that why do you insist on making me repeat myself
0,so he thinks nasa is plotting to kill the president
0,it was my dog let me ask you a question how long have you been acquainted with jerry
0,and you feel bad for it
0,you were going to ask about my nose the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today
0,excuse me
0,a dog bit it
0,can i ask you something
0,what do i look like to you switzerland
0,liza settle a bet for us
0,too bad because im terrible at yes
0,im not that good at no liza
0,look youre a nice guy but im not really dating right now
0,night after that
0,working
0,hmm how about tomorrow night
0,working
0,so you doing anything tonight
0,agent lowry
0,go ahead miss sutton
0,then this is a goddamn emergency
0,yes
0,do you uhaveu an agent lowry in your new york office
0,the office is closed for the evening is this an emergency
0,i need to speak with an agent lowry
0,federal bureau of investigation
0,what the hell does that mean
0,go to the northeast corner call a cab bring the pizza then theres a poem roses are red violets are blue if the pope goes to washington i would too
0,understood
0,ive had a lot of credentials flashed in my face liza what i saw yesterday i know not to ask questions were out shut off terminated uunderstoodu
0,we dont know who jonas is we dont know who it is were cooperating with
0,dr jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate why is that
0,i dont like it somethings wrong
0,it makes perfect sense field work is not our oeuvre
0,this doesnt make sense
0,ive been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to jerry fletcher were not to discuss him with the press the nypd anyone building police are to arrest him on sight and were to report any attempt he makes to contact you
0,i dont know if youre the best lawyer ive got or a high school sophomore
0,tell him im on vacation that i wont be back for two weeks
0,not today
0,ah your psychotic is here
0,i dont think so
0,that you come with me
0,what do you suggest
0,dont go home and dont go to work either one could be bad
0,im going to find him because hed find me
0,no idea honest what are you going to do
0,where do you think jerry is
0,jonas builds assassins for a living several of whom may be in place already wed like to kill a few birds with one stone
0,hes shown himself why havent you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do
0,hes why i watch jerry jerrys the bait for jonas
0,and jonas
0,im it really doesnt matter think cia and exponentiate im a government employee and ive been watching jerry for awhile
0,nothing i was just making sure so who are you
0,what gave me away
0,you think we have time to fool around like this come on
0,whos the deputy director of the fbi
0,what do you mean
0,i want to believe you too
0,yeah i do
0,do you believe me
0,go ahead well be right down
0,can i talk to you a second
0,your call have a good night
0,when im ready to compare notes ill let you know
0,its his show for now look you want to get some dinner inter agency cooperation and all
0,jonas
0,wasnt my idea
0,agent lowry
0,no not yet
0,youre welcome spooks so you want to compare notes on this guy
0,i was just thinking that
0,thats the book hinkley had on him when he shot reagan
0,i dont know didnt see him
0,which way did he go
0,you dont understand
0,guys a cia shrink here to id fletcher they knew each other somehow
0,wait
0,while we walk dc police want him for assault secret service for counterfeiting and were tracking him on a string of bank robberies no one knows what the cia wants him for
0,tell me about it
0,were waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up this guy fletchers something else
0,there is no abort procedure we dont know how we turned the damn thing on let alone how to turn it off
0,what
0,theres no plug to pull
0,pull the plug get her out of there
0,weve lost contact
0,ellie
0,we have benzel activation repeat we have benzel activation control to arroway you okay in there repeat control to arroway come back
0,anything happening in there el
0,im not sure we have no launch protocol the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation
0,what
0,i dont know ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology
0,you dont believe it to be tell me something doctor why do you think they would go to all this trouble bring you tens of thousands of light years and then send you home without a shred of proof sort of bad form wouldnt you say what was their intent
0,all the elements are there a woman orphaned young under a great deal of stress the failure of a project shes staked her selfworth and very sense of identity on induces a fantasy of reuniting with her father in heaven as it were is it possible
0,is it possible
0,dr arroway do you think its possible you had some kind of delusional episode
0,yes sir
0,he died in 1972
0,yes sir
0,and this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you as your father
0,its extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at
0,or youre our kind of people
0,its a hoax i knew it
0,what in the hell
0,how is that possible how could all that information be encoded in
0,hope theres a cartoon
0,okay fine theyve got the primes but if youre right about there being another more significant transmission still to come
0,mike because of the earths rotation were only in line with vega so many hours a day the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations if dr arroway hadnt moved quickly we could have lost key elements
0,dr arroway let me first say
0,michael kitz national security advisor
0,dr arroway
0,so there wasnt any clothes in the machine she was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the maytag listening
0,so
0,last week about 3 am fish dr fisher was on a late shift and he found her doing laundry
0,tell me
0,nothing okay some of us have been a little not concerned exactly but
0,still settling in really wheres dr arroway
0,glad to have you david hows the new office
0,now i remember why i went into theoretical work kent
0,for giving me a chance just for a moment to feel what it must be like to be you
0,thank you
0,nothing i guess i just wanted to thank you
0,what would you have me say david
0,ellie we both know that if i was any kind of a man i never wouldve entered this race that i would have told the president straight out helen eleanor arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass but shes got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together that more then anyone else on the planet shes earned this and that she should be the one to go because shes the best we have but thats not who i am i like to think its who i mightve been if things had gone a different way that i might have been worthy really worthy of what ive been given you do what you have to do and in the end as with everything it comes down to power and it isnt fair
0,good luck david
0,right well
0,this seemed best
0,you arent staying
0,maybe they are maybe this is all part of the package the building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale maybe requiring us to come together in this way was in effect part of the plan
0,they knew our level of development if as you say theyve done this many times theyd be well aware of the implications
0,i cant believe they wouldnt take something as basic as our biological needs into account
0,two years is still a hell of a long time and as far as we can tell there arent any provisions in the machine design for storing food water even air
0,excuse me im late for a meeting
0,you
0,as of three oclock this afternoon i submitted my resignation
0,what
0,ellie you should know that im no longer the presidents science advisor
0,im asking for your help david i want to go theyll need someone relatively young unattached and probably a scientist as the presidents science advisor you have enormous weight im asking if youll support my candidacy
0,i dont understand
0,david i know weve had our differences but ive always thought of you as a fair man even when weve disagreed and its in that light im hoping youll consider my request
0,itll just take a moment
0,actually im running late
0,do you have a minute
0,ellie
0,david
0,you were right ellie you were right all along
0,you mean
0,weve cracked it lunacharsky found it
0,what is it whats happened
0,interesting analogy and how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in africa
0,ms president this is communist paranoia right out of war of the worlds there is no reason whatsoever to believe the etis intentions are hostile we pose no threat to them it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in africa
0,its not a threat ellie its a fact if youre not careful you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly play ball really its good advice
0,are you threatening me
0,i want you to listen to me carefully the minute the implications of this message became clear this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one an extremely complex extremely volatile one there are forces at work here you dont understand i can help you up to a point but only up to a point
0,ellie
0,im going to convert mr scienceis therootofallevil this is absurd david we have work to do here i dont have time to play babysitter to the god squad
0,apparently hes genuinely interested in science this could be a chance to win him over
0,with me
0,the theological ramifications of all this are obvious the president feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them shes also named palmer joss as their liaison hes requested a meeting with you
0,what why
0,arrangements also have to be made for the vips coming in mostly religious leaders
0,rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise
0,throw a gray scale on it standard interpolation
0,you must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already
0,could it be a nested code of some sort
0,its hardly yesterday the signals been traveling for over twentysix years as for why im hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out to see if theres another message buried deeper in the signal
0,if its attention you want id say youve got it just one thing why vega everyones looked at vega for years with no results and now yesterday they start broadcasting primes why
0,mathematics is the only truly universal language senator we think this may be a beacon an announcement to get our attention
0,it was a worthy experiment worthy of you i was wrong about that part but its over now
0,david
0,then why havent you detected any signals if as you claim there have been thousands millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasnt one signal gotten through itll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through youre welcome to stay until then
0,goddamnit they are out there david
0,no youre not but the price has just gotten too high
0,the difference being what that i refuse to adopt the standard line that i dont care about the results of my work well i do care of course any discovery has to be verifiable of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method but i refuse to go around pretending im some kind of dispassionate automaton when its obvious to anyone with a brain im just not
0,the point is this isnt just scientific inquiry anymore its turned into some kind of personal obsession
0,im searching for patterns in the noise thats all order in the chaos im practicing listening
0,meaning i have to go defend a budget to the president and to congress and youre out here listening to washing machines
0,meaning
0,its not like youve given me much choice
0,you cant just pull the plug david
0,ellie i should have done this a long time ago certainly before i left the nsf but i wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt
0,its not enough having my search time systematically cut down you know im down to three hours a week now
0,you know why im here
0,did i tell you weve expanded the search spectrum were including several other possible magic frequencies not just the hydrogen line anymore i was trying to get inside their heads yknow and i started thinking what other constants are there in the universe besides hydrogen and then suddenly it was so obvious transcendantals right so weve been trying variations of pi
0,ellie
0,no doubt
0,now exactly its complicated
0,presidents science advisor so what you just spend all your time jetting around on air force one now
0,im surprised you even knew it was an election year
0,really congratulations by the way
0,very well since my appointment hes been made interim director
0,oh hows he doing
0,peter sends his regards
0,no thanks
0,pepsi tequila
0,then disagree but dont stand in my way
0,i disagree
0,what if youre wrong no ill grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence you cant deny the possibility and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly profound is worth investigation and worth taking a few risks
0,two theres nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and youd be wasting your time
0,youre
0,and only two probabilities one there is intelligent life in the universe but theyre so far away youll never contact it in your lifetime
0,dr drumlin we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity there are over four hundred billion stars out there
0,im not youre far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense
0,im willing to take that risk
0,im sorry miss arroway not only is it too speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation at this point in your career itd be tantamount to suicide
0,well
0,whats the status of the decryption effort
0,yes of course all im saying is this message was written in the language of science mathematics and was clearly intended to be received by scientists if it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush or a booming voice from the sky
0,mr ranks organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families dr arroway feel free to disagree but there wont be any suppressing of opinions here today
0,a transport so are they coming or are we going
0,and while its function remains for the moment a mystery my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind
0,how soon will you be able to decode it
0,because you cut it from the budget three years running
0,it could be anything the first volume of some encyclopedia galactica
0,what does it say
0,i dont know maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere but if there is i sure as hell cant find it
0,how can that be
0,no primer
0,and
0,weve repeated a few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one
0,what
0,maybe itll be at the end of the data when the message recycles
0,theres no way of knowing without a key a primer to help us maybe never
0,a third layer
0,in ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing it was called a palimpsest
0,what
0,analyzing signal polarization shifts
0,dr lunacharsky
0,norads not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops shuttle endeavors in sleep mode
0,hows the spying tonight guys
0,i scanned it at arecibo negative results always
0,that cant be right its only twentysix light years away
0,put it on speakers
0,hydrogen times pi got it strong sucker
0,im not sure you mind checking right ascension 18 hours 34 minutes declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes
0,got a bogey boss
0,vb10s an m dwarf signa draconis too old
0,been there done that got the tshirt
0,j39 z186
0,its incredibly rich weve been cataloging it in frames or pages right now were on 10413
0,i think we just hit the cosmic jackpot
0,its a civilian facility
0,cant we get rid of them
0,it cant be coming from vega the systems too young
0,okay lets just slow down pull up the starfield signal origin
0,thank you mr sensitive im coming at this wrong missing something something
0,youve only searched what is it sixteen hundred stars without a peep try not to take it too personally
0,never seen the optical sky myself but i hear its nice too
0,its beautiful
0,its how i hear it the displays just a little something i programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight
0,this is how you see the sky
0,here right around centaurus a
0,nice where
0,1 found a glitch in the timing probably a starquake
0,ellie pulsar
0,kent kent for chrissakes you must be eleanor
0,dr cullers
0,because i cant
0,so why dont you admit what by your own standards must be the truth that this experience simply didnt happen
0,but i dont believe it to be the truth
0,thank you doctor now
0,is it possible yes but
0,please answer the question doctor
0,by our standards yes
0,in fact by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible
0,i dont have the figures in front of me but yes that sounds about right
0,and current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes youre talking about even for a fraction of a second would require more energy than our sun produces in a year is that correct
0,there is no direct evidence no
0,i dont have an official response michael all i have are the same questions you have
0,is that your official response
0,i dont understand it all i can think is that maybe because the video gear wasnt accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design
0,thats terrific but theres one problem we dont have the means to receive all the data on our own
0,if at some later date the message proves harmless we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world but until then
0,pardon me but you cant do
0,and a hundred mile airspace
0,and a hundred mile airspace
0,colonel jarrod id like a twenty mile radiosilent perimeter put around this installation immediately
0,you dont seem to understand that its your interests im trying to protect
0,which well also need the networks help to receive and decode
0,you want to classify prime numbers
0,im saying you might have consulted us the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive
0,this isnt a person to person call mr kitz i dont really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for americans
0,ill come right to the point doctor your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of national security
0,childhood is over ellie its time to grow up
0,no please
0,its time to go home now
0,ellie this is the way its been done for billions of years
0,please if you downloaded everything about us you know the problems we face the impact it could have it could make the difference
0,no more stalling captain
0,but you said you wanted to help dont you see what it would mean
0,that isnt the way it works
0,but other people from our planet should see what ive seen they should witness this for themselves
0,eventually youll get here on your own this was just the first step in time youll take another
0,none taken but do we get to come back others of my kind i mean
0,if we dont engineer a consistent causality itll work itself out on its own and thats almost always worse ellie according to your physics none of this is possible a lot of it youre simply not capable of understanding not yet no offense
0,no i mean why so soon
0,now you go home
0,so what happens now
0,you always have been were all descendants of the same stars ellie all made of the same primordial atoms
0,all those voices you gather them all together millions of intelligences in one consciousness and now were a part of it
0,the librarian or the library
0,am i one or many
0,can you help us
0,life is unspeakably rare so whenever we do find another civilization especially one thats struggling we send a message sometimes we can offer help sometimes we cant but we always try life is simply too precious not to
0,you have your mothers hands there are no tests ellie we dont sit in judgment think of us more as librarians curators of the universes rarest and most valuable creation
0,so we passed some kind of test
0,not all some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams some never make it this far
0,the scale its just so all the civilizations you detect they all end up coming here
0,we dont know whoever they were they were gone long before we ever got here
0,so who
0,oh we didnt build it the transit system has been in place for billions of years were just its caretakers
0,and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built
0,many others
0,and those other docking ports i saw i mean there are others
0,you contacted us we were simply listening weve been listening for millions of years
0,why did you contact us
0,small moves captain small moves
0,can you show me
0,originally just another species like yourselves well not like you at all actually but
0,so who what are you
0,we thought this might make things a little easier
0,but youre so i mean how could you possibly when i was unconscious you downloaded my thoughts my memories even this beach ive never been here but i remember its how i always imagined pensacola
0,am i artifact or dream you might ask that about anything
0,so are you an hallucination or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin
0,thats my scientist
0,youre not real none of this is
0,dad but tell me how did i mean how can
0,im sorry i couldnt be there for you sweetheart
0,i used i used to dream you were alive and then id wake up and lose you all over again
0,okay
0,time to sleep now captain but you can ask more questions in the morning okay
0,thats a beauty captain now get some sleep
0,pensacola
0,okay okay there
0,mmm thats a good one maybe his echo okay no more stalling
0,could we hear god
0,big enough radio i dont see why not
0,could we hear to the moon
0,on that old shortwave maybe on a clear night come on now under the covers
0,could we hear to china
0,just be yourself captain find out where he is
0,but what do i say
0,talk to him
0,try again between the static and hey jude thats where theyre hiding
0,i cant move any smaller
0,small moves captain small moves
0,cant doctors orders the low oxygenzero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive its all right i like it here ever try sex in zerog
0,why dont you come back with me
0,of hadden industries
0,as each component was tested and shipped off to texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in hokkaido for backup purposes of course weve been right behind you the entire time you see my problem i couldnt appear to control too large a percentage my enemies wouldnt stand for it so i simply made sure the japanese consortium received the systems integration contract of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired whollyowned subsidiaries
0,mmm look closer
0,the systems integration site
0,hokkaido island
0,wouldnt you if you saw hitler on tv come i want to show you something
0,the gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us
0,i think whoever sent the message did it because theyre worried about us
0,you sound like joseph you think the world ends with the millennium
0,oh not quite yet at least for their sake i hope its not because theyre running out of time
0,what are you talking about its over
0,yes a shame still itd be worse if they died for nothing
0,it looks like pixie dust kent wouldve given anything to see this david too
0,japanese squid fleet they use lights to attract them to the surface then turn them into sushi
0,whats that
0,poor tired spinning girl how we feasted on her and now that weve had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap were pulling out thats paris where my daughter was born moscow where gangsters rule the night and i gave up smoking so many battles so many lives all that sturm and drang as if it never happened if it werent for a few power grids you wouldnt know we existed
0,its so small
0,a sunrise and a sunset every forty five minutes
0,thats my girl done
0,mr hadden im a scientist i dont make deals but if you wish to give me in good faith access to your information i can assure you that i will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesnt conflict with the best interests of science or my better judgment
0,in return you get the primer and with it the power to stay in the game do we have a deal
0,and in return
0,that would seem to be the question of the hour i want to build it doctor of course im already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption but as i said my colorful past has made many of those channels difficult to navigate i need someone on the inside
0,a machine but a machine that does what
0,very good doctor ive also detected structural elements back references a general movement from the simple to the complex all of which would seem to indicate instructions an enormously complicated set of instructions for building something
0,some kind of circuitry
0,even if he doesnt receive the entire transmission heaven is the mustard seed
0,youre saying there is no separate primer in the message because its on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is
0,not if you think like a vegan
0,a pagebreak signal a period
0,page after page of data over sixtythree thousand in all if im not mistaken and at the end of each
0,thats my girl lights
0,if i knew you any better id say that doesnt sound like you
0,ive had a long time to make enemies dr arroway there are many governments business interests even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear and i will grant them their wish soon enough but before i do i wish to make a small contribution a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet whove given from whom ive taken so much
0,youve found it what could i possibly have that you would want mr hadden
0,oh maybe not out but definitely looking for you coat i understand youve had some difficulty locating the what are you calling it the primer that will make decryption possible ive found it
0,i didnt realize i was out
0,the powers that be have been quite busy lately falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century if not the millennium perhaps youve noticed perhaps i could help deal you back in
0,what kind of deal
0,the infamous unfashionable bluntness youre here so we can do business i want to make a deal
0,why am i here mr hadden
0,i find it convenient to keep my interests mobile anyway ive had my fill of life on the ground after spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer after outliving three wives and two children i find ive had quite enough of planet earth
0,you live here
0,once upon a time i was a hell of an engineer please sit doctor i have guests so rarely its important to me they feel welcome in my home did you know this was once yeltsins flying dascha that dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot at least thats what the people who sold me the plane said
0,sr hadden you compromised our security codes
0,i think it is your naivete i like best about you eleanor oh therell be a worldwide protest but we all knew it from the very beginning you americans discovered the signal you led the decryption effort the machine is being built on your home soil of course the passenger will be an american chosen by americans anyway it is what the whole world wants no this is the big show the sort you put on better than anyone its good marketing its good casting its the american way
0,youre implying that the whole selection process is a sham
0,i do more than anything but i am also a realist soon this what is your charming term dog and pony show will finally be over and i will go home
0,i thought you were here because you want to go
0,perhaps but on the offchance that it is a doomsday device of some kind i plan to be very far away from your lovely texas when it is activated
0,id say this is slightly different
0,weve just lived through a century of incredible violence and self destruction do you call it interventionist when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck
0,very well assume this is true assume they have only the best of intentions suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us you have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs
0,but the machine worked thats what ive been trying to tell everyone the tape its all there if theyd just look at the tape
0,thats one way of putting it kitz the president the isc have shut down all official communications thereve also been reports of riots flaring up across the us and europe until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough especially for you
0,peter what is going on has everyone gone completely insane
0,how long was i gone
0,what day
0,peter what are you talking about what malfunction what day is this
0,its all right the important thing is youre safe
0,wait hold on a minute
0,thank god when we lost contact i thought we thought but youre okay were still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction did you notice anything at all that
0,im im fine
0,ellie are you okay
0,like it almost there
0,like it or not
0,that you valerian
0,its really happening
0,someone tell me this is really happening
0,you too
0,its good to see you ellie
0,peter
0,ellie
0,that is true but its also true that if i really thought we wanted the same things id follow you anywhere but the truth is i dont think you want the company be honest el theres nowhere youd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe and call me crazy but i just cant compete with that im sorry
0,you sonofabitch
0,ellie im getting married her names laura she came up to owens valley to do her postdoc about six months after you left
0,im serious about this peter
0,ellie
0,right now well drive down to ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us
0,jesus
0,and you think i dont want those things you think i dont stay up half the night wondering if ive made the right choice living half a world away from you wondering if any of this is worth what im giving up for it everyday lets get married
0,maybe thats the problem i want a family ellie i want kids a townhouse on l street instead of still living like a college kid a real life maybe that makes me a sellout but i dont care anymore its what i want
0,please youre just as ambitious as i am more
0,the work jesus ellie cant there just once be more to life than the work okay maybe thats the only way to get the recognition win the prizes
0,but the work
0,this is a chance to be of enormous help to other peoples research to have the power to be a real advocate where davids got blind spots
0,but what about your research
0,im going on staff at the nsf to work for drumlin
0,greenbank
0,im moving to washington
0,we could be together again
0,actually
0,peter if you can get him to do that for me hed obviously do the same for you we could
0,thirtyone linked dishes you could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here
0,the vla
0,what if i said i could get drumlin to agree to sell you time in new mexico
0,its almost there the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time
0,how close are you to getting this funding put together
0,if we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldnt even have the option of failing wed have to wonder our whole lives unable to do anything about it this time right now is unique in our history in any civilizations history the moment of the acquisition of technology the moment when contact becomes possible weve already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now
0,ellie even if you do manage to raise the money have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this i mean a college fetish is one thing but were talking about your career you wont be publishing you wont be taken seriously and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all
0,weve been going after some of the big multinationals but without much luck got a donation from a new york dowager weve even been thinking about selling tshirts
0,ive examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing still weve barely started
0,and
0,please any chance of that died the day david drumlin was appointed head of the nsf i have been in contact with a few other seti people weve been trying to find backing from private investors ive even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there
0,any luck on the grant money
0,i keep telling myself okay thats just the price you have to do your time doing shitwork before youre allowed to get to the good stuff but if i have to catalog one more quasar god ive missed you
0,is indistinguishable from magic
0,any sufficiently advanced technology
0,its like the precopernicans who swore the sun revolved around the earth or the victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made i mean try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us then imagine trying to explain i dunno a microwave oven to someone even a hundred years ago i mean the basic concepts didnt exist
0,they cant i think its against human nature to admit to that level of insignificance to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe
0,im just so sick of feeling defensive about the things i care about or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like drumlin when if theyd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts
0,what a coincidence it happens to be my fetish too
0,keep it down okay drumlin thinks im enough of a flake as it is look everyone here has their little fetishes caven goes to topless bars vernons got his carnivorous plants mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence
0,i read your paper on etis its brilliant
0,yavol
0,sounds like a russian general
0,peter valerian
0,ellie arroway
0,thats what they all say
0,hes an incredible prick but i never learned so much in my life
0,its beautiful but it does get a little lonely sometimes i think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isnt to avoid excess radio traffic but because were all such pathetic antisocial misfits speaking of which howre you getting on with the old man
0,drumlin said youre been down at arecibo for the last year
0,something my dad they said after all the suffering after all the desolation of the void the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other the one thing that makes it bearable is love
0,meaning
0,im not sure maybe it simply exists in the search for it maybe its something we have to make for ourselves
0,does that mean you think it doesnt exist
0,i dont know if it was a god it was searching for a greater one it was still searching for meaning
0,in other words
0,in other words god works in mysterious ways
0,maybe what you experienced cant be reduced to images on a videotape maybe they still plan to grant your request only in their own way in their own time or maybe its just like you said ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology
0,but it is a good question and i suppose ill always wonder about the answer why would they send me back without proof
0,ellie if you go out there like this if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didnt actually happen im afraid they really will crucify you please for your own sake for the sake of the world tell them what you know to be the truth tell them it really happened
0,i want to palmer more than anything but it has to be real it has to be true
0,have you seen whats happening out there the terror the despair the world is on fire ellie people need something they can believe in something worthy and you can give it to them
0,but
0,ellie the only one holding you to that standard is you the people want to hear your story they need to hear it
0,its not enough dont you understand i know it happened but by every standard of science by every standard ive lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point it may be true but it doesnt matter because i cant prove its real
0,ellie youre the proof you tell them your story ultimately theyll have no choice but to believe you
0,i dont have any proof palmer
0,it also makes god enormous i think of the scope of your universe ellie and it takes my breath away as it will everyone elses
0,youre sure you want to in the universe i saw were not exactly the stars of the show what happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small
0,i do
0,they dont believe me
0,im not sure its come to that
0,so im assuming they sent you here to administer last rites
0,pretty ironic huh i had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy just to find you
0,it was quite a page turner
0,im assuming you read my deposition
0,hi
0,hi
0,and yet thats always how i seem to end up isnt it if you really do love me palmer youll leave now please
0,ellie there is no reason you have to be alone
0,i cant hear this now
0,do you really think your life is meaningless eleanor is that why youre so quick to risk it because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose
0,i dont know
0,and then what then youll be safe
0,dont you understand i just have to hold it together just until tomorrow
0,im in love with you ellie
0,please
0,what are my other options in fifty years never
0,please palmer if you care for me at all dont push this now
0,what are you so afraid of
0,i cant do this
0,what
0,im sorry i cant
0,ellie what is it
0,what is it
0,im sorry
0,what
0,maybe thats okay
0,i do seem to be maybe because im just a little bit terrified about tomorrow
0,youre trembling
0,thank you
0,during the crusades pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show theyd actually been there i thought it sort of made sense that earth is now your holy land so
0,oh i brought you something
0,the final countdown
0,so the final countdown
0,i remember you were indelicate indiscreet and entirely less than tactful sound like anyone you know
0,ellie the last time we spoke i said some things
0,what if their answer is oh thats easy a thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape our population out of control violent crime no food so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anitsocial the weak the sick the unwanted and ever since weve been doing great
0,how do you mean
0,an excellent question doctor but what if we dont like the answer
0,another question i would ask would be a very simple one how did you do it how did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves
0,its late we should go back
0,ellie
0,what are you so afraid of ellie
0,its getting late
0,and yet youre willing to die for this cause the one thing thats given your life a sense of purpose dont you see the contradiction here
0,i dont know but as a scientist i have to consider that possibility
0,do you really believe your life is meaningless
0,maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isnt because science has obscured it maybe its just revealed it isnt there
0,i dont follow
0,did you ever stop to think that maybe that isnt sciences fault but meanings
0,i dont consider you the enemy ellie im not out to get technology i only ask the question does it have to have all the answers i look out there and i see so much emptiness people are so starved for meaning and its something they just dont seem to be getting from science
0,i thought it was wellwritten heartfelt and a little bit naive but thats just the enemys perspective
0,i wont deny i was ambitious when i had my experience i wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible im the first to admit that process included making some compromises you didnt answer my question
0,im more interested in the story behind the story how a young man goes from living on the streets of south boston to being the best selling media figure rubbing elbows with the president
0,whatd you think
0,losing faith the search for meaning in the age of reason catchy
0,really
0,i read your book
0,its what my whole lifes been aimed at the only thing thats given it a sense of purpose
0,youre willing to die for this
0,if you came back if you survived at all which its pretty certain you wouldnt
0,and everybody you care about would be dead and buried
0,something like that
0,if you came back youd only be four years older but over 50 years would have passed on earth
0,if you came back
0,relativity explain this to me one more time even if you traveled near the speed of light when you came back
0,in other words
0,in other words god is one hell of an engineer
0,its too elegant the degree of economy is extraordinary its really the next logical step even on earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature dna outclasses any computer we can come up with the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable
0,why
0,i dont think so
0,maybe youre creating a monster
0,not exactly it has organic qualities but we dont really understand how theyre integrated with the mechanical systems
0,some of my best friends are scientists theyre saying the machine is alive
0,i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors
0,some of my best friends are scientists
0,so is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this
0,prove it
0,yes very much
0,did you love him
0,i never knew my mother my father died when i was nine
0,do you love your parents
0,you may not believe this but theres a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your god to believe that were all here for a purpose that all this means something but its because that part of me wants it so badly that im so stubborn about making sure it isnt just selfdelusion of course i want to know god if there is one but it has to be real unless i have proof how can i be sure
0,look im a reasonable person and reasonably intelligent but this experience went beyond both for the first time i had to consider the possibility that intellect as wonderful as it is is not the only way of comprehending the universe that it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with
0,and theres no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it
0,i had an experience of belonging of unconditional love and for the first time in my life i wasnt terrified and i wasnt alone
0,can you try
0,its an old story i grew up in south boston more or less on the streets by the time i was thirteen id tried my first hit of heroin by fifteen id stopped using but i was dealing fulltime by the time i was nineteen i decided i didnt want to live any more at least not in a world like that one day i got on a bus i got as far as ohio before my money ran out and after that i just kept walking didnt eat didnt sleep just walked i ended up collapsing in a wheat field there was a storm i woke up and thats about as far as wordsll go
0,now you know
0,thats not doubt thats four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct i always wondered what you religious types did with your free time
0,only a tiny bit even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt
0,i flinched
0,so if i let the pendulum go when it swings back you wouldnt flinch
0,and mind yes what are you
0,and you believe this law with all your heart and soul
0,thats not faith its physics the second law of thermodynamics
0,your faith tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger only smaller
0,very smooth its palmer right where i came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards really though the bible describes a god who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old i look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies each with hundreds of billions of stars i mean burn me for a heretic but your god seems awfully small
0,my fathers house has many mansions
0,well its been a while but i dont recall the bible saying too much about alien civilizations
0,how do you mean
0,what about you doesnt all of this shake your faith at all
0,spoken like a true believer
0,i guess i wouldve felt sorry for the universe
0,and what would you have done if the odds had gone against you
0,id say logic more than faith the odds were on my side
0,what im curious about are the wilderness years youre out there all alone no money mocked by the skeptics it must have taken tremendous faith
0,make that two
0,champagne please
0,id have to say i dont know enough to have one yet for the moment i dont believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive
0,and where exactly does that put your position
0,i agree with mr rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here but i dont think it justifies taking an alarmist position dr arroway is right their chosen means of communication was a scientific one and a scientific approach is probably appropriate at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent
0,for managing the truth but the truth wont be managed sir it stops being the truth the moment you try
0,nobody is proposing we censor the truth here doctor were simply talking about putting a mechanism in place
0,i guess id say i trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of thanks for the advice but no thanks but to dilute or censor the truth for whatever reason
0,how would you propose we handle it doctor
0,you kill me you really do the first truly global apolitical event in history and you cant wait to spin it
0,yknow what fine i guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are theres no quicker way to show them
0,dr arroway you are entitled to your opinion but we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless
0,call it xenophobic paranoia dont you see the absolute absurdity of this this isnt about them its about us our violence our fear and mistrust
0,its designed purely as a defensive device call it a reasonable precaution
0,i question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed basically announcing our intentions are hostile
0,you have a question dr arroway
0,have your department make a full report
0,i dont know maybe we built the damn thing wrong maybe it was all a hoax the safest thing would probably be to do a chernobyl encase it in concrete
0,recommendations
0,as have all attempts at internal analysis weve tried sonargrams magnetic resonance gamma rays its completely impenetrable
0,thats it mike last time i checked i was still running the country although it seems that for the moment dr arroway is running the planet
0,but
0,well that would seem to decide it like it or not for the moment anyway it looks like were all in this together
0,what is it
0,oh my god
0,cut that backsass
0,but i made this arrangement
0,git movin i said

0,minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel the instrument panel was buckled inwards cracking the clock and the speedometer dials the cabin was deformed and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside the carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids
0,after being bombarded endlessly by road safety propaganda its almost a relief to have found myself inan actual accident

0,no what about your camera girl did she come
0,did you come
0,in the private aircraft hangar anybody could have walked in
0,where were you
0,yes they felt like traffic accidents
0,and did you fantasize that vaughan was photographing all these sex acts as though they were traffic accidents
0,yes i didnt plan it that way
1,and you had sex with all of these men in cars only in cars
0,the junior pathologist at ashford hospital then the husband of a colleague of mine then a trainee radiologist then the service manager at my garage
0,please finish your story
0,i dont know you can never be sure with vaughan this is his show
0,is this part of the act or are they really hurt
0,when i first met vaughan he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems i dont know what he is now
0,oh yes i thought he was a medical photographer doing some sort of accident research he wanted every conceivable detail about our crash
0,thats vaughan he talked to you at the hospital
0,who is that the announcer do i know him
0,thats the point besides i know i can give something now that i wasnt remotely aware of before its not a matter of duty so much as of commitment
0,isnt that rather too close
0,yes
0,the road research laboratory where they simulate car crashes
0,we sat in b massive traffic jam under an offramp i dont think we moved more than fifty yards im thinking of taking up a new job with the road research laboratory they need a medical officer the salary is larger something ive got to think about now theres a certain moral virtue in being materialistic im beginning to feel well its a new approach for me in any case
0,ive found that i enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic i like to look at it yesterday i hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour anywhere i said
0,are we imagining it
0,its much worse now you noticed that did you the day i left the hospital i had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason i didnt understand there seemed to be ten times as much traffic
0,look at all this traffic im not sure i can deal with it
0,do you want a cigarette i started to smoke at the hospital its rather stupid of me
0,i work in the immigration department there
0,so why the airport
0,ill wear a bloody kimono if i want to
0,i take it youre not wearing white to reassure them
0,not yet though not soon enough for some people ive already found a death in the doctors family makes the patients doubly uneasy
0,the airport why are you leaving
0,havent i to the airport if you could
0,you havent told me where were going
0,can i give you a lift i somehow find myself driving again
0,were you badly hurt i think we saw each other at the hospital i dont want the car in fact i was appalled to find that i have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped
0,i dont think we should have come here im surprised the police dont make it more difficult
0,they said it was here they told me this morning
0,its not here maybe the police are still holding it their forensic people
0,after this sort of thing how do people manage to look at a car let alone drive one im trying to find charless car
0,no thanks ill go with vaughan
0,im going to leave now do you want a lift
0,hard to say
0,what does he want from you
0,youre not jealous are you you have to understand helen and i had this strange intense experience together
0,serious but youll have to take your new friend the female crashtest dummy she dropped it off for you
0,youre kidding
0,i suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes you know jayne mansfield james dean albert camus
0,really what kind of exhibition is it
0,a complimentary ticket for a special stuntdriving exhibition definitely not part of the big auto show theres a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location
0,what is it
0,i can drive
0,can you drive
0,are you still involving me in your crash
0,you were the last one i saw just before the accident do you remember we made love
0,i saw the blood it looks like motor oil
0,theres still a patch of blood there on the road did you see it
0,im sure the police would make an exception in your case
0,no
0,are we allowed to park here
0,where are you
0,i need to see you ballard i need to talk to you about the project
0,youre right ballard theres an all night carwash in the airport service area
0,he must have driven through a pool of blood if the police stop you again they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood
0,a crude scifi concept that floats on the surface and doesnt threaten anybody i use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology
0,what about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology i thought that was your project
0,its the future ballard and youre already part of it for the first time a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us for example the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form to fully understand that and to live that that is my project
0,its very satisfying im not sure i understand why
0,the case could be made
0,is that why you drive this car i take it that you see kennedys assassination as a special kind of carcrash
0,no i mean a crash with a history camus facel vega or nathaniel nests station wagon grace kellys rover 3500 fix it just enough to get it rolling dont clean it dont touch anything else
0,you could get your wish at any moment
0,ive always wanted to drive a crashed car
0,its something were all intimately involved in the reshaping of the human body by modern technology
0,what exactly is your project vaughan book of crashes a medical study a sensational documentary global traffic
0,i live in my car this is my workshop
0,do you live here with seagrave
0,its not the police its the department of transport internal politics its a joke they have no idea who we really are
0,why are the police taking this all so seriously
0,yes
0,crash victim
0,oh
0,i have a goingaway gesture for you too
0,it was just a little goingaway gesture
0,ok good thats good thanks an awful lot for everything and for coming down here to see me off
0,so well meet every tuesday and friday and if you have any kind of emergency you can page me
0,are you saying im through with therapy
0,i think its about that time letty the charges against you have been dropped the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well
0,what
0,then you should call
0,i thought about calling but i want to wait until i know when ill be out
0,have you been in contact with the principal about your job
0,but what i really cant believe is that im starting to actually miss work
0,all i want you to do is think about whats best for you really think about it
0,first you tell me to do what i want to then you tell me to stop
0,i dont want to hear anymore
0,drugs can help suppress symptoms but lots of patients stop taking them when theyre on their own because the side effects are so harsh and michaels condition is often worsened by periods of stress hes been in and out of
0,look i know hes almost through with treatment here and hes on medication
0,then thats even more reason to listen look schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality they experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes
0,i dont need a lecture i care about michael
0,go ahead and put the guard back up letty but you need to know what youre dealing with
0,i know michaels a schizophrenic and mrs hallstroms manic depressive and john lockyer has episodes of psychosis and i heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur
0,what about michael do you know the extent of his
0,im a grown woman dr emlee i can take care of myself
0,well letty this does present a liability issue for the hospital
0,i couldnt really say anything because of that fraternizing rule
0,i miss beast a lot too
0,the question letty is how are you feeling
0,well see about adjusting the dosage if that doesnt clear in the next how are other things going
0,the medicines still bothering me it feels like i have cotton wrapped around my brain
0,i think in the spirit of group therapy its beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others
0,do we have to talk about this
0,i dont think you understand i wont wait
0,we discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind youve experienced
0,i want to see my mother immediately
0,i apologize for the inconvenience but i must ask you some
0,what kind of place is this
0,what
0,patient
0,psychologist therapist whatever
0,im afraid lhes not a doctor
0,yeah and a dimple
0,this doctor was he tall with dark hair
0,well i dont have hallucinations honest

0,its hospital policy

0,i agree with marcel i say we go to the airport and get on a plane
0,we cant
0,yeah we just go home
0,no problem
0,not a good idea someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you raymond youll steal one

0,we had a chance to walk out of zammitos house
0,what is that a threat are you fuckin threatening me marcel

0,you know what i mean im getting married soon but i havent lived the life i want
0,sure no place to bathe for days sleeping in fleainfested beds they tell you all about that in those books
0,but youre just like the characters in the stories
0,writers wouldnt sell many books if they told how it really is
0,ive read all about people like you roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way
0,fighters have rules too friendship trust integrity without rules we wouldnt survive for long
0,it must be exciting to be a fighter to be totally free
0,really
0,yes i am but i prefer the machete certain moves however call for a sword
0,youre a sword fighter too
0,youre too young to understand
0,li mu bai the famous warrior why would he give his sword to sir te
0,my friend li mu bai hes given it to sir te as a gift
0,exquisite you said it belongs to
0,beautiful but dangerous once you see it tainted with blood its beauty is hard to admire its 400 years old
0,but i have had much practice as a child in the west a platoon lived with us theyd let me play with their weapons the scabbard is so beautiful
0,the handle is heavy and the blade is no ordinary metal still the sword is the lightest of weapons youre just not used to handling it
0,its heavy for such a thin piece of metal
0,all right hurry i will hold on as long as i can
0,the antidote exists she taught it to me the formula is simple but it takes time to prepare trust me as you have helped me let me help you
0,then you have no use for the sword
0,never
0,kneel
0,give it back
0,all right if you can take back the sword in three moves ill go with you
0,what ive always wanted to teach you
0,what do you want
0,only the sword will settle this
0,lets end this here
0,not another lecture on guard
0,stop it you dont deserve the green destiny
0,make a wish lo
0,a faithful heart makes wishes come true
0,do you remember the legend of the young man
0,dont ever come back
0,jen
0,go
0,if you dont ill come after you and i wont let you off so easy
0,i will
0,keep it safe return it to me when we are together again
0,you must decide you might get tired of this life you might begin to miss your family if it were our daughter wed look for her too she would miss us jen i want you to be mine forever i will make my mark on the world i will earn your parents respect we have a legend anyone who dares to jump from the mountain god will grant his wish long ago a young mans parents were ill so he jumped he didnt die he wasnt even hurt he floated away far away never to return he knew his wish had come true if you believe it will happen the elders say a faithful heart makes wishes come true
0,dont send me back
0,it is trouble for me
0,let them look
0,your fathers men are still looking for you theyre still out there circling closer
0,i am a man and now ive found the brightest star of all
0,so youre still that little boy looking for shooting stars
0,out here you always fight for survival you have to be part of a gang to stand a chance slowly your gang becomes your family all that dark cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier
0,and so the little boy became a fearsome bandit he couldnt find the stars so he stole my comb
0,when i was a boy one night i saw a thousand shooting stars i thought where did they all go im an orphan i used to look for stars alone i thought if i rode to the other end of the desert id find them ive been riding in the desert ever since
0,give it back
0,i dont take orders from anyone
0,give me back my comb
0,im sorry i guessed wrong i though you were a han
0,by the way im a real manchurian
0,not true i can use it to pick fleas from my horse
0,its mine it means a lot to me a barbarian like you wouldnt understand
0,no more hitting on the head all this trouble for a comb
0,still in a bad mood at least youre speaking whats your name
0,you coward
0,youve got quite a temper its better this way
0,my comb
0,well there used to be whats your name im lo the hans call me dark cloud im not that tall or big but im quick as lightning
0,youre tired you need rest your horse needs water theres a creek up here
0,give it back
0,lets stop a moment
0,with all the traffic on your rooftop these days it took me a while to get in here i cant wait any longer i was wrong to let you go come back with me youll be happy in the desert youll be free there
0,you shouldnt have come
0,jen
0,lo
0,ive already wasted my whole life i want to tell you with my last breath i have always loved you i would rather be a ghost drifting by your side as a condemned soul than enter heaven without you because of your love i will never be a lonely spirit
0,use it to meditate free yourself from this world as you have been taught let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath do not waste it for me
0,my life is departing ive only one breath left
0,save your strength
0,shu lien
0,mu bai hold on give me some hope
0,that cant be everything has an antithesis why not this
0,my blood will soon reverse its flow its the same poison she used to kill my master there is no antidote
0,we followed jade fox
0,jade fox drugged her how did you get here
0,what happened
0,not a bad idea tonight well get a good nights sleep at headquarters
0,ill look around and catch up later
0,what about you
0,were close to your headquarters go home and check in
0,youre right but i dont know what to do i want to be with you just like this it gives me a sense of peace
0,to repress ones feelings only makes them stronger
0,giang hu is a world of tigers and dragons full of corruption i tried sincerely to give it up but i have brought us only trouble
0,your hand rough and callused from machete practice all this time ive never had the courage to touch it
0,not everything is an illusion my hand wasnt that real
0,shu lien the things we touch have no permanence my master would say there is nothing we can hold on to in this world only by letting go can we truly possess what is real
0,all right ill write you an introduction take it to wudan wait there for news from me
0,dont you want to see her again
0,shes out there but i doubt shell show herself well keep our eyes open sooner or later shell come for the girl
0,you think jade fox will show up
0,just be patient with me shu lien
0,i wish there were something more i could do to help you
0,i thought by giving away the sword i could escape the giang hu world but the cycle of bloodshed continues
0,its not our affair even if wudan accepts her her husband might object
0,for her they might make an exception if not im afraid shell become a poisoned dragon
0,but wudan does not accept women
0,thats not for her she should come to wudan and become a disciple
0,shes an aristocrats daughter shes not one of us in any case it will all be over soon youll kill fox and shell marry
0,she needs direction and training
0,i knew she would intrigue you
0,you did your job well but this girl i saw her last night
0,my job was to get the sword back without embarassing anyone i wasnt about to ruin her life or her fathers
0,true but i must borrow it for one last mission jade fox must die at its edge did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl
0,but its not your sword anymore you gave it to sir te
0,i admit getting it back makes me realize how much id missed it
0,well we had talked
0,then why did you come
0,i dont know it was stolen until i got here
0,what do you mean didnt you come back here for it
0,thats not what i meant i dont care about the sword
0,no id already sent them home you can blame me for losing the sword but please trust that ill get it back soon using my own methods
0,but your men are watching over yus compund
0,no not yet
0,have you questioned him yet
0,it was bo sir tes man i hear he followed the thief to the yus
0,it says jade fox is hiding at yus on the night of the theft there was a brawl near yus were you involved
0,no
0,did you see who posted it
0,be careful sir te requires discretion official business is difficult enough dont let personal feelings make it worse and i dont know even this poster could be some sort of trap
0,so i shall avenge my masters death after all
0,is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu
0,i didnt think shed dare come back to peking
0,you always suspected shed fled to the west
0,jade fox impossible
0,what have you discovered
0,but something is going on at the yu household
0,sir te believes its a ploy cast suspicion on governor yu
0,perhaps
0,join me once you have finished i can wait for you in peking
0,first i must visit my masters grave its been many years since jade fox murdered him i have yet to avenge his death and yet im thinking of quitting i must pray for his forgiveness
0,come with me to peking you can give the sword to sir te yourself itll be just like old times
0,so what will you do now
0,its time for me to leave it behind
0,you use it justly youre worthy of it
0,too many men have died at its edge it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade
0,i dont understand how can you part with it it has always been with you
0,i am he has always been our greatest protector
0,the green destiny sword youre giving it to sir te
0,perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me
0,were preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking
0,something i cant let go of you are leaving soon
0,what was it
0,no i didnt feel the bliss of enlightenment instead i was surrounded by an endless sorrow i couldnt bear it i broke off my meditation i couldnt go on there was something pulling me back
0,you were enlightened
0,during my meditation training i came to a place of deep silence i was surrounded by light time and space disappeared i had come to a place my master had never told me about
0,why youre a wudan fighter training is everything
0,i left the training early
0,the mountain must be so peaceful i envy you my work keeps me so busy i hardly get any rest
0,yes
0,monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain he said you were practicing deep meditation
0,fine
0,good and how are you
0,it has hows business
0,mu baiits been too long

0,a female criminal now thats news
0,yes the very killer of li mu bais own master last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her down
0,a murderer
0,no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking
0,but dont be too lenient
0,sir te knows that even wellmeaning people can make mistakes that can bring ruin to themselves and their families
0,thats good sometimes the help cant keep their hands to themselves its very embarassing
0,we know who stole the missing item if the thief returns it im sure sir te will pursue the matter no further
0,i heard sir te lost something and now madame tes not feeling well
0,im sorry shes not feeling well enough to receive you today
0,madam te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts shes being so considerate
0,father let me avenge my mothers death

0,we must avenge mother
0,its jade fox
0,the best way to trap a fox is through her cubs
0,what do you have in mind
0,sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter
0,this is a delicate matter
0,we must be careful governor yu is a court official and in charge of security any disturbance will cast suspicion on him it might get sir te in trouble
0,then someones trying to set him up we should inform li mu bai
0,but the sword could be in his compound
0,yes though i doubt hes involved in this
0,has governor yu ever seen the sword
0,when it comes to emotions even great heroes can be idiots tell me if li mu bai is not more open the next time you see him ill give him an earful
0,i beg your pardon li mu bai and i arent cowards

0,once the emptiness in amys life is filled the dream will go of itself if a up to you both of you only you two can bring her into a real world you must give her the friendship and love she craves
0,how
0,its perfectly normal for a child to dream i can see how a sensitive little girl finding this portrait would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend that image dwells only in her imagination and that image can go as quickly as it was born
0,i can see it allthe very day it began amy was lonely she was desperate for friendship i remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring that must have been the day she first wished for a friend
0,what do you mean
0,forgive me but it was superstition foolish childish wishesthat started all this
0,its been ages since ive even thought of a mummers play when i was in college we used to do them every year — st george and the dragon all kinds of sword dances

0,thats exactly what i told mr reed but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you miss callahan
0,to a situation really mr reed there isnt anything to worry about it was only a slap
0,all right amy go tell edward to take you
0,but it wont be christmas tomorrow

0,the farren house
0,on the back street — a green house
0,someone gave it to you where was this old house
0,at the old house with the voice
0,but where did you get it amy
0,thats what i wished on edward says its a wishing ring and it is

0,i know dear i understand but try to worry a little less about her be a little easier in your thinking and especially today — lets forget about it we want a really bangup birthday party dont we
0,no its not that its because i know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves imagine things i love amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals i saw what happened to irena with her cat people
0,thats why i can tell you straight out you think too much about irena blame yourself for her death and its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about amy

0,shes not irenas child theres nothing of irena in her shes my child
0,id hate her to grow up like that

0,look im a victim here too i was a year away from getting my masters in art now ill never graduate my life has been permanently disrupted
0,you seem very savvy for a man whos been found mentally incompetent to stand trial
0,it was my finger that pulled the trigger but im not morally responsible my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of how could i know im not a doctor
0,so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people
0,yes my psychiatrist didnt insist that i stay on my medication
0,your doctor
0,this had nothing to do with shoes that didnt fit or my relationship with my father who as you know made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor
0,were trying to get there i hope we can
0,continued
0,im sorry dr smyslov but im really not at liberty to discuss this
0,continued
0,how did they manage to do that without any communication
0,continued
0,well i suppose theyve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment
0,continued
0,shes wonderful
0,continued
0,im afraid ive only got a few minutes but id love to
0,continued
0,well how nice to see you again elena youre looking wonderful
0,space stattion 5 lounge
0,roger
0,i think ill have to go out and burn them off
0,i guess not
0,i guess you dont know your own strength old boy
0,i didnt do that frank i took particular care not to freeze them
0,well now that weve got one thats actually failed we should be able to figure out whats happened and fix it
0,its the last one
0,yes
0,hal
0,well i hope theres nothing wrong with the assembly on those other wise were out of business
0,two more
0,two units in four days how many spares do we have
0,i dont know hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure
0,no
0,youre kidding
0,well hals reported the aounit about to fail again
0,oh im fine im wide awake whats up
0,are you reasonably awake
0,good morning hows it going
0,anyway its just as well that we replace it better safe than sorry
0,yes but its more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
0,i suppose computers have been known to be wrong
0,yes i dont know what to make of it
0,well thats something
0,still all we have to do is ask hal
0,i guess it isnt
0,i suppose it isnt logically impossible
0,but not completely inconceivable
0,i know it would be almost inconceivable
0,yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us
0,not really though it is strange when you think about it it didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training
0,thats true
0,just ask hal its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal
0,how
0,of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
0,yes i thought so
0,that seems very unlikely
0,i dont know all i heard is that theres something about the mission we werent told
0,oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard
0,no as a matter of fact i didnt
0,yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital checkout
0,oh
0,i suppose so though of course theres a more sinister explanation
0,i suppose the idea was specialized training
0,no i never did either
0,i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
0,i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out
0,well what do you think we ought to do about it
0,its possible
0,not really they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall and that were being charged against differ ent accounting offices
0,yesterday i finally called the accounting office at mission control and all they could tell me was that theyd received the ags19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either
0,yes
0,really
0,interesting that you mention it because ive got the same problem
0,thats right well naturally i didnt say anything to payroll i assumed theyd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque but its been almost three weeks now and im still being paid as an ags18
0,well i got the papers on my official upgrading to ags19 two weeks before we left
0,yes
0,its about my salary cheques
0,whats up
0,well its nothing really important but its annoying
0,sure what is it
0,dave if youve a minute id like your advice on something
0,okay come on down
0,okay
0,right just a sec
0,hi frank coming in please
0,listen to me very carefully hal unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection
0,i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission
0,i am prepared to do that anyway
0,hal unless you follow my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you
0,im sorry dave but in accordance with subroutine c15324 quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it
0,hal im in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control
0,i can tell from the tone of your voice dave that youre upset why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest
0,i dont like to assert myself dave but it would be much better now for you to rest youve been involved in a very stressful situation
0,hal switch to manual hibernation control
0,look dave yourve probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me
0,im goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please
0,if youre determined to revive the crew now i can handle the whole thing myself theres no need for you to trouble
0,i dont really agree with you dave my onboard memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements
0,it doesnt have to be hal its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth let me have manual control please
0,repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation
0,the antenna has to be replaced
0,i suppose its because youve been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that theyre not supposed to be revived for another three months
0,i suppose youre pretty broken up about it
0,yes it is
0,too bad about frank isnt it
0,well thats a relief you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission
0,yes it is hal
0,is your confidence in me fully restored
0,and dont you worry about it
0,well dont worry about it
0,im sorry about the misunderstanding hal
0,naturally dave im not pleased that the aounit has failed but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability i certainly wouldnt want to be disconnected even temporarily as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history
0,okay hal well lets see the way things go from here on
0,look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the aounits and with your test gear
0,hal is there anything bothering you anything that might account for this problem
0,im not questioning your word dave but its just not possible im not capable of being wrong
0,yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail
0,you probably also know that we found them okay
0,yes i know
0,you know that we checked the two aounits that you reported in imminent failure condition
0,sure dave whats up
0,not now hal id like to talk to you about something
0,i understand hal well take care of it please let me have the hard copy
0,the unit is still operational dave but it will fail within seventytwo hours
0,my fpc shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit
0,what is it hal
0,sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think weve got a problem
0,hes got a point
0,im sorry frank but i dont think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know
0,well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going
0,continued
0,still you really dont believe it do you
0,continued
0,well its silly but if you want to why dont you
0,coninued
0,well what is it
0,continued
0,did they have any explanation for this
0,continued
0,yes i remember you mentioning it i got mine about the same time
0,continued
0,goodbye daddy
0,bye bye now sweetheart
0,yes daddy
0,ill wish you a happy birthday now and ill see you soon all right darling
0,thank you daddy
0,okay sweetheart have a lovely birthday party tomorrow

0,one two three can i speak to mommy

0,no im sorry darling i told you i wont be home for a few days
0,are you coming to my party
0,yes i know that sweetheart
0,im having a party tomorrow
0,im fine daddy when are you coming home
0,im at space station five darling how are you
0,ill bet its a fortune
0,i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty
0,yes well whatever it is theyre certainly not fooling around this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week
0,berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight
0,i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
0,well ive heard more and more people talk of an epidemic
0,well hows it going back there
0,thank you
0,oh thank you very much
0,thank you its been a great pleasure to meet all of you dr smyslov
0,well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you
0,well i hope that you and your wife can come to the iac conference in june
0,no thank you and im afraid now i really must be going
0,are you sure you wont change your mind about a drink
0,well that does sound very odd
0,clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal
0,well where are all of you off to
0,hes fine but im afraid we dont get a chance to see each other very much these days
0,how is gregor
0,oh thats such a delightful age
0,oh shes growing up very fast as a matter of fact shes six tomorrow
0,and your charming little daughter
0,yes its coming along very well
0,i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking
0,yes i think so just about then
0,fine
0,well shall we go through documentation
0,yes very pleasant
0,well did you have a pleaant flight
0,please it really doesnt matter
0,well thank you very much for being so understanding
0,im terribly sorry i was just on my way down to meet you i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time and i was on my way out of the office when suddenly the phone rang
0,how do you do mr miller
0,dr smyslov im not permitted to discuss this
0,this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts
0,quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius something apperently of an unknown origin is this in fact what has happened
0,certainly
0,dr floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question
0,well im glad about that
0,fortunately they did
0,yes well i hope the crew got back safely
0,yes and im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the ias convention
0,i see
0,thats right
0,you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
0,yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days
0,yes well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order
0,really
0,well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius
0,im sorry but im not sure i know what you mean
0,yesas a matter of fact i am
0,are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius
0,well as it happens im on my way up to the moon
0,yes really thank you very much
0,are you quite sure
0,oh i really dont have time for a drink if its all right ill just sit for a minute and then ive got to be off
0,i dont think it has but id like to check that simpson whats the log on that
0,has it been exposed to any sun before now
0,well not really at first glance black would suggest something sunpowered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device
0,any ideas about the colour
0,tomb shine surveymarker spare part take your choice
0,but you dont have any idea as to what it is
0,not really its completely inert no sound or energy sources have been detected the surface is made of something incredibly hard and weve been barely able to scratch it a laser drill
0,any clue as to what it is
0,by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill
0,how can you tell it was deliberately buried
0,yes it does the subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago
0,im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement
0,dr floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps
0,well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable
0,no of course captain i can understand your concern
0,well fine thanks very much anyway and i hope you dont mind me asking
0,yes well i wouldnt have been too concerned about it except ive heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact ive heard that ten people have died already
0,i see well im sorry about that i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm
0,well ill tell you why i ask you see ive got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i havent been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears im a little concerned about her
0,i take it this is something to do with the trouble theyre having up at clavius
0,i see
0,well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twentyfour hours and then were going to back empty
0,what do you mean
0,incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements
0,thank you
0,oh no thank you the two girls have taken wonderful care of me im just fine
0,were scheduled to dock in about seven hours is there anything we can do for you

0,tell me something why didnt you just take the money off luther and split
0,so you took the rest of the night off
0,they must have set up a meeting for the morning luther left an 8 am wakeup and put up the dont disturb sign hes trading his girl for the money all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind
0,let him get some sleep hes going to need it
0,maybe we should pay luther a visit

0,yeah it doesnt look like hes gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy
0,a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row
0,if hes hoping that then hes dumber than i think he is which would be amazin cause i already think hes real dumb
0,maybe luther hopes ganzll give him a piece of your money
0,you got a very depressing view of life man you gotta smile once in awhile
0,im not in this cause its fun im not into hitting guys cause it makes me feel good either i do it cause it works
0,doesnt it get tiring
0,if they dont tell me what i need to know
0,say do you always work people over like you did luther
0,that aint philosophy thats common sense
1,i let women get to me the quest for pussy is the meaning of life i got my own personal philosophy about em keep women separate from guns money and business women are for spending money they got nothing to do with helping you make it
0,i suppose youd never be like luther and let a woman get to you
0,oh yeah does bein in love make you stupid
0,im tellin you the mans in love he wants to be a hero for his girl

0,im not so sure about this
0,this doctor and wife theyre nice people but they dont want to get too involved theyre not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either you and i both know sometimes not often but sometimes theres real reasons why a kidll run molestation whatever besides that the girls probably eighteen so shes legal
0,why dont they come to me
0,for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive
0,we do
0,i figured you share information
0,why not go to the ncic or ncmec
0,few days ago i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia a doctor and his wife what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81 which heads into philadelphia started up a conversation with this girl she looked homeless seemed about eighteen maybe they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city nice kid mature didnt have much to say but they got a sense shes a runaway so all through dinner the doctors working on her trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone not surprisingly she ate her food excused herself thats the last they saw her the reason they came to me for help the reason im coming to you is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch they want to see if i can id this girl somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kids alive doing alright
0,absolutely of course ill abide by whatever decision you make but id appreciate if youll hear me out
0,there are reasons for the way we do things here

0,thats trust mr christian trusted me implicitly
0,so he sent you gave you the money his errandboy and if you refused it wasnt like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film thats the beauty of lawyerclient privilege
0,wouldnt exactly have been possible for a man of his stature
0,you were the middleman am i right old man christian wasnt about to go shopping for a snuff film himself
0,well whatever reasons mrs christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator i should certainly be a party to but since she feels differently i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval
0,thats right
0,you are a private investigator
0,of what sort
0,as mr christians attorney and one of the executors of his estate it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend
0,im listening
0,yes i do have something to say i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs christian contacted you
0,its not my money the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought lets not make a big deal out of this okay go be a race car driver go run for president whatever

0,first of all basement sales like tonight arent gonna last much longer its too risky one and two everythings going on the internet anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants its heaven for those degenerate chickenhawks theyre swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap em but theres still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes no one knows where it comes from thats local underground where information spreads by word of mouth those are zombies hardcore junkies their hands are permanently pruned they go out in the sun they dont burn they blister other than that all i know about is the mail classified ads in the paper with hidden codes secret couriers credit card orders to dummy corporations interstate wire transfers revolving po boxes but if youre asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit who knows thats the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible and vice versa and cops cant trace the deal theres ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is
0,what other ways are there to get illegal films who do you see
0,i heard you asking that guy wasnt yanking you around theres no such thing
0,snuff films
1,and bondage films they straddle the line how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not step over that line youre into kiddie porn rape films but there arent many ive never seen one
0,child pornography
0,what you saw tonight were not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend were talking about stuff where people get hurt specialty product
0,interesting theory

0,i dont know if lucks the word are you feeling alright
0,how are you having any luck
0,mrs christian tom welles here
0,hello
0,youre one hell of a detective mrs christian
0,you told me to look so i looked
0,send it to me through the post office like we arranged no return address you dug this up all by yourself
0,okay
0,for a human life murder on film no statute of limitations who knows it sure could have id like you to overnight me a copy of those checks then put them in a safe deposit box
0,do you think the film could have cost that much
0,im here
0,hello
0,to the penny exactly one million dollars in cash
0,youre joking
0,totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
0,okay i follow you so far
0,one was for two hundred thousand one dollar and thirteen cents another was for three hundred thousand six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents
0,the checks were for odd amounts
0,im not positive this means anything
0,my husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash
0,okay
0,i know what im asking your compensation will be appropriate to the risk youll need cash to buy information and ill provide it i feel responsible mr welles you saw what he did to her
0,nothing remotely like this
0,youve found missing persons before
0,i deal in divorce cases corporate investigations
0,any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously ive thought about it and theres no other way if you cant find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well i cant let that happen im telling you i wont if theres no chance that poor girls memory can be served then ill just have to spend my last days trying to forget her
0,it wont work like that
0,no for me to live with the ruin of my husbands name i need know that whoever did this will be punished if you can find them i will take their names to the police ill say my husband confessed on his death bed ill say i didnt have courage to come forward at first
0,you dont have any other choice
0,i told you i cant not yet
0,you you need to go to the police
0,of course but im certain its nothing to worry about
0,will you watch it and see for yourself
0,im sure it is its probably something your husband was given as a bad joke more than likely he never even watched it
0,im telling you its not that
0,if you were to study it youd see the camera cutting away youd see the tricks they can play
0,no
1,please believe me this is probably a stag film simulated rape hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic fake blood and special effects
0,mrs christian please will you sit down a moment i want you to listen carefully what youre talking about is a snuff film but from what i know snuff films are a kind of urban myth like red light district folklore theres no such thing i can assure you
0,i didnt know what to think i cant tell you how horrible its been to know this belonged to my husband to know that he watched this this atrocity but i cant go to the police
0,this is a movie showing a girl being murdered shes sitting on a bed and a man rapes her and he begins to cut her with a knife i only watched what i could
0,im afraid i dont
0,its a film of a girl being murdered
0,cash stock certificates and this
0,do you want to tell me what you found
0,there was nothing he could do my husband left everything to me i prevented anyone from seeing the contents i felt these were my husbands private things i didnt i didnt realize
0,you hired someone to open it ill bet the lawyer loved that
0,my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe i knew about it but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business not till now that is
0,just curious
0,i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to other than that theres never any reason
0,do you carry a gun mr welles
0,we were married fortyfive years hard even for me to imagine we had our troubles there were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and i to him i loved him deeply
0,he succeeded
0,mostly thats where he started his empire building he was a good man notorious as an eccentric but that was something he cultivated he wanted to be legendary
0,pittsburgh
0,ill do whatever i can to help

0,ive spoken to friends of mine and my husbands in harrisburg in lancaster and hershey asking about you i must say you have friends in influential places
0,hes a lawyer please sit here
0,hes odd
0,thank you

0,apparently mr longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak
0,uh huh pleasure
0,i try to be
0,mister welles youre very prompt
0,they murdered her mrs mathews im sorry it happened a month after she ran away shes been dead all this time
0,why why are you doing this to me
0,they killed her and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her
0,no no no
0,he raped her andandand he murdered herhe cut her up with knifes
0,no
0,they brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her
0,who are you
0,someone some men they took your daughter and they drugged her and they took her to a motel room they did terrible things to her
0,who is this
0,mrs mathews your daughter is dead shes dead
0,what
0,she went to california to los angeles she wanted to start over she wanted to be an actress
0,what are you talking about
0,i have to tell you something it wont be easy for you to hear its about your daughter mary anne when i when i was there with you her diary in your attic in silverware if you read it youll know what im telling you is true
0,i remember you just left
0,mrs mathews its thomas do you remember i was there a few weeks ago asking about your daughter
0,hello
0,what am i supposed to do forget her time heals all wounds right shes all i think about and ive learned to live with that but you want the truth the real truth if i had a choice if i had to choose between her being out there living a good life and being happy and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her or her being dead and me knowing id choose to know
0,its been six years
0,i think about it everyday but every time the phone rings every single time i still think its her
0,yes
0,you were right i didnt find anything im going to run and get something to eat are you hungry
0,youre probably right and i probably wont find anything i dont have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and theres a part of me that cant let it go police are just as human as you or i they could have missed something they probably didnt wouldnt you rather know
0,my husband never laid a hand on her she would have told me she would have told me
0,will you let me look
0,how how can you say that to me
0,if the police focused their search in her room her belongings well thatd be only natural but they may have been looking in the wrong place
0,no you dont have any reason to think that
0,it is possible and i know this isnt something you want to hear your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it she might have wanted to tell you something
0,i dont know i think so
0,do you think the police did a good job
0,there wasnt one the police looked
0,its not really my place but its not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either see i know a little about missing persons when kids run they almost always leave a note its guilt they want to say goodbye
0,what
0,ive got what i need for my report there is there is one thing that bothers me though
0,you should be
0,no
0,are you religious
0,were all like that
0,doesnt make much sense does it when everythings happy when lifes fine and you have every reason to believe theres a god you dont bother then something horrible happens thats when you start praying all the time thats when you start going to church
0,okay
0,i i shouldnt take anymore of your time maybe we can finish tomorrow ill call tomorrow
0,of course
0,people remember me from the news can you drive me back now
0,no one knows what its like you cant even imagine how much it hurts
0,i had to ask i apologize
0,you try going through what we did bob couldnt take it thats all christ theres times when it still seems like i cant either
0,i didnt mean to
0,there wasnt anything like that the police and the fbi people asked but there wasnt anything happened like that never my husband his heart broke when mary left
0,you have to forgive me but in these circumstances with your daughter were there any indications of any sort of abuse
0,it got to be too much for him
0,why do you think he did it
0,we were divorced by then things fell apart he was living with a friend
0,september 4th 1993 about a year after mary disappeared
0,yes
0,if theres anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but i have to ask your husband he committed suicide
0,i dont know
0,what was she running from
0,she didnt seem herself for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it one night we went to bed the next morning she was gone she took some clothes
0,she just seemed depressed
0,no
0,so she didnt leave a note she never gave any indication where she might go before she left
0,you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses want to know what its really like its sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wifes cheating on him glamorous huh and the guy who hired you he has a hairlip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wifes cheating and you dont blame her
0,i didnt think there were private detectives anymore except on tv
0,thats exactly what i am
0,they hired you youre like a private detective
0,its very important you dont let this raise your expectations its not going to effect any ongoing efforts all im saying is please know im not here to create any false hope
0,well im following up on your daughter mary height five four weight hundred ten pounds brown eyes blonde hair born april 24 1976 missing june 11th 1992 a runaway thats how shes listed is this information correct
0,no
0,right agent cole told me hed call and let you know to expect me he didnt call
0,neil neil cole
0,what was the name ive got it here somewhere

0,mark
0,why dont you shut up and let her talk two of us died in the last two days does that strike you as particularly normal
0,faint
0,vomit
0,two hours a day six days a week
0,dan and hes taking alice with him pretty good dive yvonne youve been practicing
0,and his egghead son well give em a uroughu ureceptionu wont we
0,i wouldnt worry so long as we have boats like the tiger shark and people like you the skipper dave kent sir ian and my father
0,i dont know
0,but if they udou
0,maybe just maybe when their ship doesnt return theyll decide not to come here after all
0,which is the one we have to worry about
0,yes
0,theyre so remote cold beautiful the stars but now i wonder
0,id sooner swim
0,however our ideas disagree as ive said before im unotu a coward and it happens youve got no choice either uiu take you down there in the lungfish or you dont get there
0,any more than being the son of captain neilsen does
0,thats enough holloway ive told you before wearing boards on your shoulders and parading with a stiff spine doesnt auto matically endow you with back bone
0,thenthis is a flying saucer
0,unidentified flying objects
0,you may not uwinu them but without men like your father to degrade himself by fighting to preserve them or as much as we have of them theyd have disappeared ulongu ago
0,peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit show me a man who says you win uthoseu by fighting wars and uillu show you an idiot
0,you mean unothingu is worth fighting for
0,perhaps but the idea of willingly going to uschoolu to spend my ulifeu at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunderlizards im referring to war uthatu strikes me as the uworstu cowardice of all being spiritually yellow
0,youre really a mixedup oddball arent you
0,that may be but dad stays where uheu is and im staying here
0,were uallu risking our lives
0,wearing a uniform doesnt bestow an automatic monopoly on courage ucommanderu it just so happens im unotu a coward physical or mental and before id risk my fathers life
0,uyouu said it but i wont argue
0,you trade school boys are all alike arent you anybody who doesnt happen to think like a little goldbraided puppet is ipso facto a coward
0,your father can be in nome alaska tomorrow we have two choices ask them to send him out in a copter and take you off or the shark can put back into nome
0,what did you mean im out
0,dead matter of fact hes much better hes left the hospital
0,my father hes not
0,your out this came for you
0,what is it
0,not in two days look do you think i uwantedu to come if it didnt mean so much to dad proving his depthexplorer its the last thing id want
0,you could train someone else
0,and they thought uyouu could re place the skipper
0,it was moderate hell be all right but it was out of the question his coming along
0,how is he
0,it was supposed to be dad had a heart attack two days ago
0,i should have suspectcd when i heard that doctor i thought it was your father
0,whats goin on in here lad what
0,dave
0,oh it does
0,here keep these it wants me to come alone
0,im with uyouu
0,well
0,well have to look for them later
0,wonder where powell and carney are
0,somewhere down there
0,where do you think the voice you heard was coming from
0,the sound again
0,you hear that
0,lets get back to work and maybe we uwillu be soon
0,and if i didnt uknowu better id swear we were moving
0,you know it uisu
0,hey you know somethin its getting lighter in here
0,strange you didnt hear it omit 274f
0,i dont hear anything maybe youve been down here too long why dont you go back up and
0,listen hear that
0,yeah
0,go back and tell dr neilsen have him report to the skipper
0,i think youre right
0,whats more important theres our problem the bow ram the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break if we can cut the ram the shark can pull herself loose
0,how about that the bow drove half through her but she sealed herself right up
0,not ualoneu youre not
0,you all wait here im going inside take a look
0,reef and i can take the explorer down clamp it around the eye and
0,us
0,youve got to let us try skipper
0,skipper look at the depth gauge
0,were stuck tight
0,sounds like it distress call from a small freighter between ellesmere island and greenland one mayday thennothing
0,cyclops
0,his side ive seen it all right a nice bright yellow
0,have you ever talked to carl tried to see his side
0,but utheyreu not skipper neilsens son it broke his heart then when some newspapers called carl the honest sincere son of a warmongering father captain neilsen resigned from the navy oh he still keeps his hand in playing around with projects like the lungfish but it broke him all the same
0,a lot of people think like that
0,so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school be gins making noises like a pacifist a real egghead dogooder and crackpot ban the atom tests junk the nuclear subs spend the mili tary budgetfor peace
0,so
0,one of the finest men and officers alive a real hero in the best sense of the word in world war two he taught us engineering and design fought like a demon to develop atom subs
0,i guess
0,i guess skipper neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the academy didnt he
0,i might have a son like uthatu
0,huh
0,youve asked why i stay a bachelor there goes the best reason i know
0,disappointing a ubigu girl
0,what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl
0,uthatsu the worst possible moment
0,at the worst possible moment tomorrow is janies birthday poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home now
0,so they caught up with you too
0,reef
0,helen i appeal to you
0,but julies a nice girl and ive seen you work she deserves a fighting chance
0,now dave old buddy you know youre exaggerating what do you think of this husband of yours on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer but unfortunately in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself
0,we hope
0,sidearms but the saucers dead
0,with their underwater experience theyll be invaluable take sidearms and flare pistols
0,the frogmen
0,you better take powell and carney with you
0,right at our oneeyed friend
0,what course skipper
0,what
0,a mass of jellylike stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo
0,speedabout twentytwo knots coursedue north
0,course and speed
0,idont know
0,what about down
0,seems to be all around
0,is there any way out of it
0,right skipper
0,get ready we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard
0,what
0,were dead in the water but it indicates were moving
0,why do you say that
0,the inertial navigation system must have been knocked out in the crash
0,something wrong
0,skipper could you take a look here
0,all internal repairs completed and frogmen report exterior damage minor
0,yes griff
0,excuse me skipper
0,what about time
0,its possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the pole
0,anything
0,excuse me captain there may be one last desperate chance a oneinathousand shot
0,radiation levelconstantly rising
0,now they feel itdown below
0,thats wonderful carl reef thinks they can clear the shark bow so we can pull ourself loose
0,wonderful
0,we read you go ahead doctor theyre inside the saucer its filled with breathable air
0,as ready as we ucanu be ill report to the skipper
0,all ready
0,there is i believe our friendcyclops is returning to life
0,theres got to be an explanation
0,as we near the pole
0,what direction does the system indicate
0,the radiation level from the saucer its rising
0,if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted
0,in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and as you put it recharging his batteries
0,the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all the earth itself
0,uweu harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force maybe cyclops does it on a usuperu scale
0,we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear but suppose it isnt at all what if its umagneticu
0,what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit perhaps be lying there waiting
0,suppose our theorizing is correct then this ucouldu be the next danger point
0,above murmansk and finland
0,highintensity arcs will burn submerged and millions of voltsdischarged in random directions
0,under uwateru
0,it doesnt seem possible but could it be an electrical storm center
0,minus three
0,whats the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole
0,nothing we can do now
0,straight to the pole at almost fifty knots
0,if we could get inside the saucer use our torches maybe we could cut the shark loose
0,what
0,suppose theres an atmosphere of some kind inside cyclops
0,and were at safe maximum depth already stop engines
0,its the screws skipper at our declination angle running in reverse theyre pulling the shark uandu cyclops right to the bottom
0,a hundred and eighty fathoms we cant be sinking that fast
0,we can uramu him
0,but what can we accomplish
0,thats what i said
0,right uatu him
0,thirtyfour seconds
0,whats the running time
0,take a look
0,youre sure its cyclops
0,after torpedo room report
0,determine extent of damage immediately
0,i think i should have joined the air force
0,what do you think
0,itll be all right were old friends
0,huh
0,doctor neilsen when did uthatu happen
0,dr neilsen hell be
0,who with
0,im afraid i have some bad news for you reef youll have to share quarters this trip
0,i met dr kent once
0,i did go just back reef these are a couple of our passengers sir ian hunt and dr clifford kent my exec commander richard holloway
0,thought you were going to washington skipper
0,uthatu might be a ulittleu uroughu
0,obviously
0,to navigate wont you have to see your way
0,of course but it is time to be gin the return voyage
0,thats why no water leaked inside when we rammed you
0,it is a living thing when damaged you would say wounded it immediately heals itself
0,i have selected you to return with me along with several other specimens for study we will examine you and the others discover desirable features to incorporate in our earthcolonizers
0,why
0,on the contrary i want you unharmed perfect
0,why not me what am i the closing act
0,i am afraid not therefore
0,he did
0,your friend was to remain where he was
0,swell
0,for horrors like yourself
0,my mission is to study various solar systems and planets select the most suitable for colonization
0,tell me something why can uiu hear you when the others couldnt
0,point of view is everything to us uyouru form of life is ugly as we appear to you
0,thats a ufaceu
0,come where
0,remove your weapons commander and come here alone
0,all right go to it
0,cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks
0,toward the pole
0,due north at five knotsno six
0,but uanswersu are what we need not more questions
0,weve asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times
0,or perhaps until he gets us
0,you plotted the course of cyclops then thats uouru course wherever uheu goes uweu gountil we get him
0,our cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt itself
0,just musing about our oneeyed adversary and the legend of homer cyclopes were the sons of heaven who forged the thunder bolts thrown by zeus
0,ill be another
0,well ill be
0,the pattern each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle
0,see what
0,thank you
0,my yeoman will show you to your quarters
0,all the figures show is that gordon lariviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as selectman in a year or two you wont recognize this town

0,they must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft something you dont even see
0,well sometimes theyre not completely covered but they dont freeze
0,and there
0,no my dear it is true thats how they live in the other world here we dress to have our bodies covered to keep warm
0,now ninotchka youre exaggerating
0,yes
0,you mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day
0,when you get up you put on a negligee and then you change to a morning frock
0,what do you wear in the morning
0,a dress you wear in the evening
0,evening gown
0,an evening gown
0,as beautiful as that what else come tell me
0,it was very silly i would be ashamed to wear it here
0,what was it like
0,well a hat
0,tell me what else did you have
0,no i left everything in paris i just happened to be wearing this
0,ninotchka you know i am your friend you can trust me did you bring back anything else
0,thank you anna ill dry it up here when i wash it next i should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear
0,you know how it is today all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counterrevolution
0,i see
0,when i passed through the laundry yard today i saw all the women huddled around this so i brought it up here things like this create a bad feeling first they didnt know whose it was then they saw the paris label and did it start a commotion some said its what we all ought to wear and others said its like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline it undermines our whole cause
0,you should ill show you
0,i have nothing to hide
0,thats just it it makes people feel queer i dont want you to get in any trouble
0,i havent talked to anyone about paris i havent said a word
0,ever since you have been back from paris
0,about what
0,and you too ninotchka
0,you should be more careful anna
0,ill tell you later that gurganov you never know whether hes on his way to the washroom or the secret police
0,it just goes to prove the theory of our state if you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if youre true to the collective spirit and stick together youve got an omelet that reminds me have you heard the latest theyre telling about the kremlin
0,well ive saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so well manage
0,an omelet arent you living a little above your ration
0,an omelet
0,what are you serving
0,a few friends just a little dinner party
0,i know my heart is sad but my feet are happy when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata not bad at all are you expecting someone
0,too bad you missed an inspiring day anna
0,they didnt let me i am in disgrace last week at the performance of carmen i played a sour note the conductor got so excited he yelled theres sabotage in the string section
0,no the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade
0,arent you late
0,good evening ninotchka
0,good evening anna
0,right now its on the balcony
0,it may step out of a bazaar it may wait for you in a corridor it may hide in the shadow of a minaret
0,imagine we dont have to whisper any longer
0,we are not comrades any more we are friends ninotchka
0,i know but if we cant put in all these wonderful things at least lets put in some imagination in that one omelet well taste the whole of paris
0,and the surprise is theres nothing in it
0,des raisins de mad�re des framboises
0,lets fill it with confitures des prunes
0,i should be a swallow right now i would be sitting in front of the caf� de paris picking up flakes of french pastry that would melt in my bill
0,if you asked him why he left france i bet he couldnt name one good reason
0,it is ninotchka it is he must have been in paris you can see it in his whole attitude he just picked up a crumb of our black bread shook his head and dropped it
0,thats another thing its spring
0,can you blame them at least the may day parade is over
0,how nicely youve fixed the table ninotchka
0,a little more tact look how nicely shes fixed the table all for us
0,i can tell you exactly
0,if you hadnt given commissar razinin such a wonderful report about us who knows what would have happened
0,thats right
0,imagine for once in our lives we were in paris and we never went to the eiffel tower
0,or we cant go back to russia
0,or it might be the firing squad
0,you must help us leon if you dont win her over were on our way to siberia
0,once in petersburg i was driving down the nevsky prospect in my cart and her highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction and when i couldnt make way quick enough she spat in my face
0,imagine the niece of the czar opening the door for us
0,thats her

0,so you want to make a strike breaker out of me i am surprised at you comrade is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch all i can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that royal suite
0,send me a plate of raw carrots and beets beets predominating on a ratio of sixtyforty what there is a strike in the kitchen good will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause i hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables what you wont serve me either now look here comrade i think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me youre weakening the people
0,room service speaking

0,its false sentimentality

0,it looks pretty hopeless there may be a chance thats all the french government has recognized soviet russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake he might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money money money thats all they are interested in those lawyers
0,what did he say

0,my little volga boatman stop threatening i dont deserve this are you my little volga boatman
0,imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages i can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments
0,i understand how you feel but there is a limit to everything particularly pride and dignity they are willing to pay any price they have a circulation of two million
0,was it for this that i refused to endorse dr bertrands mouthwash i could have made a little fortune by saying that the vincent vacuum cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the romanoffs and now you want them to smear my lifes secrets over the front page of a tabloid
0,sweetheart we wont have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past
0,oh leon
0,now listen swana i sold monsieur guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the gazette parisienne the life and loves of the grand duchess swana of russia
0,what a gruesome proof of the power of the press
0,youd be surprised how many nice people dine with the guizots
0,those newspaper people
0,we can be rich if you say the word i had dinner with the guizots last night
0,oh leon you are so good to me
0,we can forget horse racing roulette the stock market our worries are over you remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers you will be in a position to give it to me
0,did you win
0,darling i was busy looking out for your interests
0,dont you find that restful why didnt you come last night
0,your conversation has one marvelous advantage swana however many questions you ask you never expect an answer
0,its really a wretched morning wretched i cant get myself right i wanted to look mellow and i look brittle my face doesnt compose well all highlights how can i dim myself down leon suggest something i am so bored with this face i wish i had someone elses face whose face would you have if you had your choice oh well i guess one gets the face one deserves
0,good morning swana
0,hello leon
0,i think i know leon quite as well as you possibly a little better leave that worry to me fiveforty leaves you time enough to close the deal with monsieur mercier but naturally youll be too busy for any farewells ill see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and i will also see you to the airport thats my proposition comrade yakushova
0,thats not the way to win him back not leon
0,i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that fiveforty plane to moscow
0,go on
0,no i just wanted to be absolutely impartial both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years we can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition ninotchka now realizes what she is after
0,i see you have calculated in terms of hunger
0,i may run out of money but you have already run out of bread two years is a long time for your comrades to wait
0,wont those two years in court be expensive for you i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people but now
0,my lawyer agrees with you he says france will uphold it in every court but i will drag you through every court dont forget that and when i say it will take two years i am as always conservative
0,under soviet law the jewels belong to the state france is going to uphold that ownership
0,unfortunately
0,in other words moral ideas have no weight with you all right then lets deal with legal facts you know that france has recognized the soviet
0,now lets free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way our situation has changed considerably before i had only a claim to the jewels now i have the jewels
0,i told you we had plenty to talk about shall we sit down
0,they always belonged to the russian people they were paid for with their sweat their blood their lives and you will give them back
0,thats very simple to answer they were given to me by my mother they were given to her by her mother in fact theyre mine you cannot steal what belongs to you
0,i will have to face the consequences but so will you dont forget they will ask how you got them
0,wont it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them
0,you leave me no choice
0,dont worry fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian i just put this on for sentiment the rest are absolutely safe i assure you but if you feel like notifying the police
0,where are they
0,you were very careless with our precious jewels my dear theyre too expensive a toy for two children to play with
0,where are they
0,believe me leon cant help you he doesnt know anything about the jewels i give you my word i swear it
0,i told you to go madame
0,i wouldnt waken leon after last night i would say not before three oclock at the earliest
0,in that case i can only say goodby
0,not before you agree to use those reservations to moscow
0,i must insist that you leave
0,you cant deny we gave the people their moneys worth almost eight tumbling romanoffs eight
0,my dear you dont know how impressive i could be did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels
0,it is not enough to be witty madame people grow tired of being entertained you made that mistake before problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony
0,very interesting my dear but couldnt you write all that from moscow a dissertation on love on soviet stationery would be an amusing paradox
0,people cannot be taken away madame neither a hundred and sixty million nor one not if you have their love you hadnt thats why youre not in russia any longer and thats why you came here this morning
0,my palace in petrograd yes you took that away from me you took away my czar my country my people everything i had but nothing more i warn you
0,if this is meant to be a joke it is not funny or do you still think youre issuing orders from your palace in petrograd
0,dont worry i have already made reservations its perfect flying weather they assure me theres a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to moscow in no time
0,madame if you
0,leave thats exactly what i came here to ask you to do leave i dont mean this hotel and i dont mean paris i mean france theres a plane for moscow at fiveforty
0,i must ask you to leave
0,thats all right i grow on people
0,madame what is it you people always say regardless of what you mean i am delighted to have you here i have not reached that stage of civilization
0,now there you are completely wrong if we sit down for a little chat im sure we wont run out of conversation and whats more it wont be dull
0,we have nothing to discuss
0,i just dropped in to have a little hearttoheart talk with you

0,youre right madame it will all be over by thursday
0,youre absolutely right about the cossacks we made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts they had such reliable guns
0,exactly you see it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear lowcut gowns in the old russia the lashes of the cossacks across our backs were not very becoming and you know how vain women are
0,isnt it amazing one gets a wrong impression of the new russia it must be charming im glad conditions are so improved i assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances
0,dear me i must be losing my finesse if im not careful ill be understood by everybody
0,not at all i understand perfectly count dalgout gave you a dog you made it very clear madame

0,may i ask what has happened
0,i havent either but ive heard about them you must realize it was only on the strength of your paris report that i sent them to constantinople without that i never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal

0,for christs sake it soils my mothers memory do you think i want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this raising a dirty mouth
0,you dont need to check the tape i know what i said
0,we could check the tape again sir
0,never i never said that about jews
0,you did say it sir
0,youre lawyers how can you let this shit go by look this nixon cant say this
0,then tell richardson to fire him
0,sir if i may echo my concern
0,they cant impeach me for bombing cambodia the president can bomb anybody he wants
0,sir the charges are serious first abuse of power second obstruction of justice third failure to cooperate with congress and last bombing cambodia
0,yeah well i own the fucking casino
0,thats helms hes sang froid a worldclass poker player
0,well he certainly isnt acting like it
0,hes nervous sir hes heard youre looking for a new director
0,well see about that
0,frankly sir it stinks i have no access im lucky helms lets me have a staff
0,hows the job coming bob
0,then his office will be fine
0,no his office i want a very private conversation i dont want to be bugged
0,he told me to take you to his conference room
0,so lets go
0,uh hes rushing back from his tennis game sir
0,where the hell is he
0,mr president i dont know what to say as soon as we learned from the secret service you were en route the director was notified he should be here any minute
0,good you know how i feel about loyalty im not going to let any of my people go to jail that i promise you the important thing is to keep this away from haldeman and ehrlichman im trusting you to do that john i have complete confidence in you
0,i understand that sir
0,john you dont want to start down that road i remember what whittaker chambers told me back in 48 and he was a man who suffered greatly he said on the road of the informer its always night this is beyond you or even me its the country john its the presidency
0,im not going to be the scapegoat for this haldeman and ehrlichman are in just as deep as me
0,nobody knows more about this thing than you do john
0,you want me to put it all in writing over my signature
0,we have nothing to hide but the only flaw in the plan is that theyre not going to believe the truth that is the incredible thing
0,no we have nothing to hide
0,hes right maybe its time to go to the hangout route john a full and thorough investigation weve cooperated with the fbi well cooperate with the senate what do we have to hide
0,i mean who the hell cares about this pennyante shit goldwater put it right he said well for christs sake everybody bugs everybody else we know that its the coverup not the deed thats really bad here if only mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it give them the hors doeuvre and maybe they wont come back for the main course thats the tragedy of all this mitchells going to get it in the neck anyway its time he assumed some responsibility
0,i agree its ridiculous but
0,jesus everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types the softheads the average people dont think its much of a crisis for christs sake its not vietnam no ones dying here isnt it ridiculous
0,sir i still dont think uh we can contain it anymore theres a cancer on the presidency and its growing with every day that
0,you say john cut our losses and all the rest but suppose the thing blows and they indict bob and the others jesus youd never recover from that john its better to fight it out instead and not let people testify
0,im still not confident we can ride through this some people are going to have to go to jail hunts not the only problem haldeman let me use the 350000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments ehrlichman had a role a big role in the ellsberg breakin and im uh i think its time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses
0,we could get a million dollars we could get it in cash i know where it could be gotten
0,uh huh
0,we could get that
0,uh i would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years
0,how much do you need
0,either it goes to mitchell or it comes here
0,mitchell mitchells family
0,i like that thats a solution
0,hunt has nothing to lose now pardon all of them nobodys going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned
0,what
0,executive clemency
0,pay him pay him what he wants
0,he says if he doesnt get it right away hes going to blow us out of the water and he means it ever since his wife died in the plane crash hes been over the edge
0,son of a bitch
0,mr president hunt wants more money another hundredandthirty thousand
0,then what about this washington post crap woodwind and fernstein
0,siricas just trying to force one of them to testify but theyre solid
0,so what about those watergate clowns john this fuck siricas crazy thirtyfiveyear sentences there were no weapons right no injuries there was no success its just ridiculous
0,excia theres no such thing as excia john theyre all ivy league establishment is he one of these guys with a beef against us
0,the bigger problem i see is this guy who was arrested mccord james mccord he headed up security for the committee to reelect he turns out to be excia
0,john sooner or later sooner i think you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to richard nixon that hes the darkness reaching out for the darkness and eventually its either you or him look at the landscape of his life and youll see a boneyard
0,howard youll serve no more than two years then hell pardon you
0,im one of his people the cubans are his people and were going to jail for him
0,to protect his people
0,thats not the question john the question is why is he paying
0,how the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the president of the united states
0,in richard nixons long history of underhanded dealings he has never gotten better value for his money if i were to open my mouth all the dominoes would fall
0,is it
0,ill bet he would
0,the president would like to know if that was the last payment
0,yes i got the money
0,i was sorry to hear about your wife
0,so you tell mitchell
0,dick nixon saying im sorry thatll be the day the whole suit of armord fall off
0,eight words back in 72 i covered up i was wrong im sorry and the american public wouldve forgiven him but we never opened our mouths john we failed him

0,we ought to fire his whining ass right now when hes on top you know what itll set the right example for the rest of this administration
0,my god my god he talked to the new york times
0,so that explains his press notices working both sides of the fence jewboy henry always trying to get his nobel prize get laid

0,alright but why if kennedy is so clean in all this didnt he cancel track 2
0,because because dick helms knows too much if anyone in this country knows more than i do its hoover and helms you dont fuck with dick helms period
0,so you wanted castro dead everybody wanted castro dead if hunt and the others are cia why dont we just throw this back in the cias lap let richard helms take the fall
0,and not just hunt frank sturgis all those cubans all of them in the watergate they were involved in track 2 in cuba hunt reported to my military aide but i met with him several times as vice president thats what worries the shit out of me i dont know how much hunt knows or the cubans
0,jesus
0,he didnt veto it i ran the white house side the mob contact was johnny roselli one of the cia guys was that jackass howard hunt
0,before eisenhower approved that
0,the first assassination attempt was in 60 just before the election
0,chile congo guatemala cuba wherevers theres a need for an executive action capability theres a track 2 in cuba track 1 was the bay of pigs invasion track 2 it was our idea we felt the invasion wouldnt work unless we got rid of castro so we asked ourselves who else wants castro dead the mafia the money people so we put together track 2
0,i dont understand track 2s chile
0,yeah but roselli wasnt just any gangster he was the gangster who set up track 2 in cuba
0,what that he knew johnny roselli hoover knew a lot of gangsters
0,he wasnt protecting me he was putting me on notice
0,i unlike senator kennedy have a plan to end the war but not for peace at any price but peace with honor
0,cue the crowd go to the womans group get the bald guy hes great
0,no
0,dick you dont have to make a statement herb covered it for you
0,where are they
0,the bastard if id called his shot on cuba i wouldve won he made me look soft
0,meanwhile what happens to the country
0,an open invitation for mr khrushchev to become involved in latin america we would lose all our friends in latin america
0,hes treading water dont mention khrushchev
0,i think i think thats the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that helping the cuban exiles who oppose castro would uh not only be a violation of international law it would be
0,he wouldnt do the makeup said it was for queers
0,when we consider the lineup of the world we find there are 590 million people on our side 800 million on the communist side and 600 million who are neutral the odds are 5 to 3 against us
0,yes sir ill talk to helms and uh whats our press position on this watergate thing what do i tell ziegler to tell them
0,no no not tonight dont let her in here i have too much to do
0,ill talk to helms oh pat asked if youre coming to the residence for dinner tonight
0,this isnt a moral issue bob we have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes the fbi is filled with people who are pissed that i put gray in and not one of their own vietnam china the soviet union when you look at the big picture bob youll see were doing a hell of a lotta good in this world lets not screw it up with some shitass thirdrate burglary
0,sir
0,i suppose you thought the presidency was above this sort of thing
0,because the president says it is my job is to protect this country from its enemies and its enemies are inside the walls
0,how is this national security
0,its got nothing to do with justice its national security
0,the only problem with that sir it gets us into obstruction of justice
0,christ youre right gray makes jerry ford look like mozart just have helms call him helms can scare anybody
0,hell need a pretext hell never figure one out for himself
0,pat grayll do anything we ask him thats why i appointed him
0,yes sir but do you think grayll go for it
0,just do what i say bob
0,the bay of pigs that was kennedys screwup how does that threaten us
0,play it tough thats the way they play it and thats the way were going to play it dont lie to helms and say theres no involvement but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors bizarre without getting into it say the president believes its going to open up the whole bay of pigs thing again tell helms he should call the fbi call pat gray and say that we wish for the sake of the country dont go any further into this hankypanky period
0,all right
0,weve got to turn off the fbi you just go to the cia bob and tell helms that howard hunt is blackmailing the president tell him that hunt and his cuban friends know too damn much and if he goes public it would be a fiasco for the cia hell know what im talking about
0,thats right and its more a problem for ehrlichman he fixed hunt up with the phony cia ids but what else does hunt have on us
0,uh no one of course is going to see these tapes but
0,you approved that before the fact because i went over it with you but
0,bob did i approve the ellsberg thing you know im glad we tape all these conversations because i never approved that breakin at ellsbergs psychiatrist or maybe i approved it after the fact someday weve got to start transcribing the tapes
0,no keep trini out of this chotiners too old and for gods sake keep colson out its time to baptize our young counsel that means dean can never talk about it attorneyclient privilege get to it and dean you stay close on this
0,should we talk to trini about paying these guys or maybe chotiner
0,well work on it i say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and thats all there is to it
0,national security priority restricted and controlled secret
0,national priority
0,how about a comint classification we put it on the huston plan even the designation is classified
0,security is not strong enough
0,but sir youre covered no one here gave orders to break into the damned watergate were clean its only the ellsberg thing and if that comes out its national security
0,silence
0,but what are we paying him for
0,what do you mean sir
0,howard hunt jesus christ you open up that scab and you uncover a lot of pus
0,our own intelligence capability to fix the leaks
0,well why not
0,we were working on china
0,fucking hell
0,it was right after the pentagon papers broke they went in to get his psychiatric records
0,i did
0,yes you approved it sir
0,i had nothing to do with that was he in the ellsberg thing
0,definitely colson had him trying to break into bremers apartment after bremer shot wallace to plant mcgovern campaign literature
0,on the list of horribles i know what he is and i know what he tracks back to you say he was involved in the plumbers
0,howard hunt is working for the white house no shit this is goddamn disneyland since when
0,he works for colson he used him on the pentagon papers were trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a white house consultant after the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his white house safe
0,apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through mexico the fbis onto it we could have a problem with that
0,whats liddy got
0,well you know sir hes a nut he used to work here with the plumbers and now hes running this watergate caper you remember his plan to firebomb the brookings using cubans as firemen he wanted to buy a damned fire truck magruder thinks hes just nutty enough to go off the reservation
0,that fruitcake what about him
0,we feel the bigger concern is gordon liddy
0,contributions it was a legal contribution who the hell authorized this colson
0,its possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal howard hughes donation to the democrats so the democrats couldnt make an issue of your hughes money
0,their fourth
0,it was just a fishing expedition apparently it was their fourth attempt at the dnc
0,but obrien doesnt even use that office the democratsve moved to miami theres nothing there
0,evidently to install bugs and photograph documents
0,they did what i dont understand whyd they go into obriens office in the first place
0,thou must find thy peace at the center richard strength in this life happiness in the next

0,i said i didnt need a free ride i need a suit
0,whatd you say
0,what do you think he said in life theres no free ride
0,whatd he say
0,black irishman very moving turning and turning in the widening gyre the falcon cannot hear the falconer things fall apart the center cannot hold mere anarchy is loosed upon the world and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity but it ends so beautifully ominous what rough beast its hours come round at last slouches toward bethlehem to be born yes this country stands at such a juncture
0,no
0,you must be familiar with my favorite poem by yeats the second coming
0,no they make me sick they smell like death i had two brothers die young but let me tell you there are worse things than death there is such a thing as evil
0,flowers are continual reminders of our mortality do you appreciate flowers
0,i never thought jack was ready for the presidency but i would never never consider his death was awful an awful thing for this country do you ever think of death mr helms
0,so president kennedy thought
0,cuba would be a small price to pay
0,by offering cuba to the russians as a consolation prize
0,but if we were able to separate china from russia once and for all we can we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century
0,this is an extremely dangerous direction mr president terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement
0,is that why you and kissinger are negotiating with the chinese
0,cia policy the cia has no policy mr helms except what i dictate to you i try to adjust to the world as it is today not as you or i wanted it to be ten years ago
0,but it has never been the policy of this government to accept that and it is certainly not cia policy
0,mr helms weve lived with communism in cuba for ten years
0,it is not my practice to spy on the president doctor kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own
0,not if you have spies in the white house it isnt your job
0,my job unpleasant sometimes is to know what others dont want me to know
0,are you tapping kissinger
0,i dont think we can treat this as a formality mr kennedy made a verbal promise to the russians not to invade cuba but you authorized dr kissinger to put this in writing
0,well well lodge a formal protest
0,we have recent intelligence that a soviet nuclear submarine has docked at cienfuegos
0,yes
0,mr castro
0,what
0,it will take a little time but ill order a search for your papers though it does raise a disturbing issue
0,yes and you will give general cushman full access
0,and of course i accept im flattered and i want you to know i work for only one president at a time
0,firing you mr helms wouldnt do any good of course youll continue as dci youre doing a magnificent job
0,and me
0,the president would support a reasonable request for an increase
0,current levels may not be sufficient
0,i promised the american people peace with honor in southeast asia that could take time two maybe three years in the meantime your agency will continue at current levels of funding
0,not if i give you all the cards
0,im not jack kennedy your agency is secure
0,president kennedy threatened to smash the cia into a thousand pieces you could do the same
0,im interested in the documents that put your people together with the others all of them
0,diem trujillo lumumba guatemala cuba its a shame you didnt take similar precautions dick
0,yes
0,youre referring of course to chairing the special operations group as vice president
0,yes it involves some old and forgotten papers things i signed as vice president i want the originals in my office and i dont want copies anywhere else
0,is there something else thats bothering you mr president
0,screw congressional oversight i know damn well going back to the 50s this agency reports what it wants and buries what it doesnt want congress to know pay close attention to this
0,im sure you realize this is a very tricky area mr president given our charter and the congressional oversight committees
0,then find something and i want these leaks stopped jack fucking anderson the new york times the state department i want to know whos talking to them
0,of course weve tried but so far weve come up with nothing that
0,youre correct im concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests whether they know it or not the fbi is worthless in this area i want your full concentration on this matter
0,i suppose mister president youre unhappy that we have not implemented your domestic intelligence plan but
0,i didnt choose him as my deputy mr president you did
0,robert cushman is a lieutenant general in the marine corps the deputy director of the cia and this is what you use him for
0,and so shall i arrange some coffee would you general cushman
0,my friends call me mister president
0,im honored dick that youve come all this way out here to virginia to visit us at last
0,if things remain as they are hes got the antiwar vote
0,ummm
0,would you walk with me down to the paddock id like to look at the horses for the eighth
0,little bobby

0,hes obsessed with his own image he wants his nobel peace prize a little too much as the late doctor king proved even an ape can win a prize with good press
0,kissinger
0,well you have cia people all over the place helms has seen to that then theres kissingers staff kissinger himself i believe maybe the leaker
0,who do you think is behind it
0,that was a mistake the white house was full of kennedy people then it still is
0,we took his system out
0,johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office
0,we cant keep a goddamn secret in this government edgar theyre stealing papers right out of his office

0,the little bastards think they can ruin tricias wedding day by dancing naked in the reflecting pond
0,remember what lenin said in 1917 mr president the power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up the communists have never been closer now is the time to go back to the old themes the ones that made you president let the communists know youre onto them
0,there must be a quartermillion out there edgar theyve been at it now for a year young kids just like tricia i dont know do you think they have a point edgar maybe this whole damned system of government is
0,the old queen did it on purpose
0,you asked if you could count on my support as long as i can count on yours

0,that depends who writes the history books im not a quitter but im not stupid either a trial would kill me thats what they want but they wont get it
0,they will understand sir to be undone by a thirdrate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions history will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries
0,yes you always had a good sense of timing henry when to give and when to take how do you think mao brezhnev will react do you think this is how theyll remember me henry after all the great things you and i did together as some kind of of crooks
0,oh god im going to throw up
0,because people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook well i am not a crook i have never made a dime from public service
0,can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved
0,yeah
0,mr nixon it is possible for even a president to go too far
0,resent it all you want henry but youre in it with the rest of us cambodia ellsberg the wiretaps you put in the president wants you to know you cant just click your heels and head back to harvard yard its your ass too henry and its in the wind twisting with everyone elses
0,i had nothing to do with that sir and i resent any implication
0,that doesnt matter now henry the point is you might lose some of your mediadarling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry
0,idiotic yes i suppose it was
0,i i heard something it sounded idiotic
0,all kinds of shit would come out like the ellsberg thing you knew about that henry didnt you
0,but it must be done your government is paralyzed
0,housecleaning it would be ugly henry really ugly
0,jews and negros dont win elections henry better to hang them around the democrats necks
0,youll pick up the middle on this one the jews and negros
0,we have to entertain the possibility
0,thats right and if necessary ill drop the big one
0,this is a major coup gentlemen our own state department doesnt even know and if it leaks out of here tonight
0,mr president this cannot be breathed especially to our secretary of state that cretin rogers the chinese would never trust us again the only way i emphasize only way to pull this off is in secret
0,this will get me a second term damn it without risk theres no heroism theres no history i nixon was born to do this
0,thats what geopolitics is about the whole world linked by self interest you tell me ron how the hell i can explain that on television to a bunch of simpleminded reporters and weeping fucking mothers
0,exactly yes mr president that is my contention
0,thats triangular diplomacy gentlemen
0,no one understands even my own men what do you think the communists respond to honesty liberal guilt soulwringing crap fathers on tv crying hell no i understand the communist mind ive studied it for thirty years they grasp realpolitik better than any of us right henry
0,exactly sir that is your historical contribution to lead boldly in an era of limits
0,what i think is theyre cowards their opposition represents the cowardice of the eastern establishment they dont realize as you do mr president that the communists only respect strength and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the madman richard nixon
0,i didnt ask what your staff thinks henry what do you think
0,well as you know most of my staff have weighed in against this incursion they believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily and will result in crushing criticism domestically
0,but they all got it back again didnt they we should have lunch sometime
0,churchill degaulle disraeli they all went through the pain of losing power
0,finally someone whos noticed im a great admirer of yours too mr nixon you are an unusual politician we share a mutual idol six crises sounds like a page from churchill
0,as the old alliances crumble
0,were gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything thats sick and evil about the eastern establishment you and your plumbers are gonna find dirt on this guy lets see him going to the bathroom in front of the american public and when we finish with him theyll crucify him
0,theres no other choice
0,alright henry were gonna go your way crush this ellsberg character the same way we did hiss
0,and what do we get for it gobs and gobs of bullshit gossip nothing someone is leaking weve got to stop the leaks henry at any cost do you hear me then we can go for the big play china russia

0,i was the lesser of two evils
0,you know i voted for you in your last election

0,mr chairman there is an old saying the enemy of my enemy is my friend
0,dont ever trust them they never tell the truth or honor their commitments vietnamese are like russians both are dogs
0,we know youve taken a great risk in inviting us here

0,i said im not listening and i think looking at something that firm you and your droopy little excuse for an arse would be welladvised to keep quiet

0,the truth is
0,yes thats fine of course i you know of course ill just be getting along then nice to see you

0,but yesterday that actor asked you who i was and you just dismissed me out of hand i heard you had a microphone i had headphones
0,yes the thing is i have to go away today but i wondered if i didnt whether you might let me see you a bit or a lot maybe see if you could like me again

0,no mister harding that is not true
0,is it true mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday
0,yes mister harding
0,yes thank you miss ratched since our last meeting i have been reflecting quite seriously on the nature of my problem naturally im referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain no no to personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function regardless of the function we will confront the question of yes yes the question of existence relationship function confront yes confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis yes the crisis of our souls of our souls which i am trying to fully understand the problem the problem not to shut ourselves off but somehow somehow to understand fully our capacity to obtain to personify the question existence depends depends on the question to reflect to reflect
0,yes mister harding
0,i mean the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having i know that to be the case but the way in which you broached it if thats your idea of teaching me something
0,no secrets mister harding lets get it all out in the open
0,have you ever speculated mister harding that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements
0,i can only speculate as to the reasons why
0,why
0,yes that is correct
0,and yet you suspect her
0,no miss ratched
0,but you have no proof
0,yes miss ratched this is correct
0,am i to take it that there isnt a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter mister harding youve stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men
0,he also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere but he didnt say how he has been heard to say to his wife i hate you i dont ever want to see you again youve betrayed me so does anyone care to touch upon this further
0,yes thats perfectly correct
0,at the close of fridays meeting we were discussing mister hardings problem concerning his wife mister harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street is that correct mister harding
0,mister washington

0,peter peter was a mistake an imposter
0,what about peter
0,yeah well obviously it wasnt meant to be ive got fortyeight hours i can still make it home in time to marry dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened
0,and a fortune teller
0,it was a ouija board remember
0,i know but
0,i thought you were the one who didnt think i shouldve come in the first place
0,so youre just quitting just like that
0,why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place children are very impressionable you know
0,okay a lot of bad luck but that means the odds are probably in your favor now this is no time to give up
0,a little bad luck
0,so youve had a little bad luck
0,because ive been kidding myself because i realized you were right from the beginning this whole thing was just a wild goose chase
0,why
0,packing
0,sightseeing whatre you doing
0,hi whereve you been
0,hiiii
0,men have ways
0,but how could he know he only just met me
0,yeah sociopaths theyre able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that
0,dont be silly hows a psychiatrist gonna find him
0,no like a psychiatrist
0,like a detective
0,i think its time we got some professional help
0,i meant about my idea
0,that was really sweet
0,and then we rent a truck or a car either one and we set up a loudspeaker and we drive through the surrounding areas and we page him
0,and then what faith
0,okay heres what i think we find out what all the subway stops for that train are the subway systems really not that big in rome we could narrow it down and
0,well nobody can say we didnt try
0,good luck
0,what
0,faith
0,right okay its meant to be right this is it
0,faith so far youve trailed the man halfway around the globe at this point i dont think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales
0,right right okay you dont think hes gonna think im too aggressive
0,nope
0,is he looking at us
0,hes sitting in the fourth booth down on the left hand side with his back to us hes wearing a navy jacket if you turn around you can see part of his right elbow
0,oh my god where
0,hes heeeeeerrre
0,okay okay you join him but first will you ask if hes here
0,not if you dont count the sixth grade
0,sure you did
0,i never even got to be single
0,because im the one whos single
0,well how come were always looking for guys for you
0,i told you if he sees me here with another guy hes gonna think im here with another guy i just dont want to send any confusing signals
0,so whats in a name i wanna join him i dont see why we cant join him
0,youve travelled over six thousand miles and now youre gonna play hard to get
0,i sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe hed notice me first
0,youre right at least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself smile
0,all of the sudden im feeling kind of nervous god i hate blind dates why couldnt we just have arranged marriages in america
0,whats she saying
0,i dont know i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden
0,what did you say to her
0,right my brother
0,her brother
0,anna im faith you dont know how happy i am to meet you you see im trying to find someone and
0,polo
0,larry bought himself cologne
0,he went out and bought himself mens cologne the other day did i tell you that
0,and you know what i thought then kate i thought i hope someday i have somebody who loves me that much i still hope that
0,that was a long time ago
0,you know when larry and i got married i thought we were so lucky we found each other so early people talk about spending their lives together how many of them really get to but maybe i was wrong maybe sooner or later everything wears out
0,course he does
0,you think he misses me at all
0,i dont know kate i just said that im sorry im just on edge im afraid were losing him
0,so what exactly is larrys side of the story anyway
0,sorry
0,well you dont have to get snippy with me
0,you expecting somebody you know
0,nothing
0,whats that supposed to mean
0,you know no offense or anything kate but i think im starting to see larrys side of the story
0,im hungry
0,right so we shouldve been able to cover more of them
0,we wouldve had enough gas to get us there if you hadnt gotten us lost besides a kilometer is less than a mile
0,i told you a liter was less than a gallon
0,the book said they have a lot of rail strikes in italy
0,couldnt we just have taken a train

0,only what
0,a phone message only

0,maybe theres fingerprints on it
0,a rich possibly fat slob
0,a butterfinger wrapper
0,whatd you find
0,ah ha
0,so maybe his room hasnt been cleaned yet maybe theres something in there that might help us maybe theyll let us go in and take a look around
0,so
0,the guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago right
0,i just got a dial tone
0,i dont think he understood what you were saying whats the airport number
0,did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned
0,you cant really blame him for being upset it was an armani suit
0,he fell out
0,what are you doing
0,faith ive seen it already okay if i spot somebody whos got a head thats an eighth of an inch around standing underneath a tuba ill recognize him from the photo otherwise im telling you its not gonna do me any good
0,just once more so youll be sure to know what to look for
0,you and the other 99 of the women in the world

0,youre just going to fly to italy and start combing the streets
0,thank you so much
0,my god you have
0,no i havent and you forgot about the fortune teller
0,look i know you think this is irresponsible of me but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person
0,i cant believe we did this do i have to remind you that your wedding is in six days
0,of course not i told him i was going to visit a great aunt and dont tell larry either
0,does dwayne know about this
0,would you stop saying that i need you to do me a really big favor
0,because you were afraid to fly
0,thats where youre wrong i got one nine years ago i just never had an opportunity to use it
0,you dont have a passport
0,i have vacation time coming to me
0,what about your job
0,its still the new year

0,the woman at my dry cleaners believes theres no such thing as coincidence
0,its a coincidence
0,its a miracle
0,after all he is my brother and i know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes but i know him pretty well and i really dont think

0,have you seen him with someone
0,i think hes having an affair
0,is that bad
0,larry brought me flowers last night
0,kate is something the matter
0,i mean just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that its all supposed to be perfect well guess what it isnt not for you not for anybody
0,i understand kate what do you think of this garter
0,people have problems insecurities flaws and you have to learn to compromise to overlook to forgive its not settling faith its life real life
0,i know youre right
0,let me tell you something about love there are no prince charmings there are no glass slippers love is hard work
0,yeah i guess youre right i really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den
0,but one day you wake up and realize youve been had of course life isnt like the movies thats why there are movies
0,thats the problem when youre a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies dreams come true the good guys win people live happily ever after all that crap turn
0,oh i dont know i guess its just not quite the way i always thought it was going to be you know like in the movies
0,but what
0,i know it was
0,i think it was sweet of him to pick it out
0,look how big it makes me look i look like an alp
0,come on its not so bad
0,well i wouldntve if i hadnt thought i was in love
0,yes you did
0,he begged me to marry him i didnt even want to marry him
0,if youve never been out with him how do you know you dont want to go out with him

0,so whats your point
0,but somebody wrote those songs
0,yes you know all the shrinks on donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds peoples fantasies
0,is everything okay
0,i think if youre honest with yourself youll admit youve had a chance at a number of amana appliances in your lifetime
0,metaphorically i still dont have an amana freezer
0,its a metaphor its women who always think theres some unknown out there thats going to be better than whats in front of them and instead wind up with nothing
0,i dont have an amana freezer
0,dont tell me oprah did a show
0,so you gotta be a little flexible look at your brother and me larrys not perfect neither am i but we work it out were not unrealistic in our expectations and we have each other i think youve got the door number three syndrome

0,we was robbed last night and we cant find no books
0,well where are they
0,sure we keep records
0,you mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixtyfive thousand five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records

0,all right dont worry ill be right beside you
0,im not sure i care to find out what it is
0,somethings making that music

0,she is to be bmineb it is so spoken
0,ahh but i declare there is still time for isomeithing

0,i called your room from downstairs
0,oh god

0,well does it make sense to you
0,its not a game something you play

0,dannys not coming
0,nice to meet you betty
0,oh this is betty
0,you too lieutenant
0,hello lieutenant good to see you
0,and if we fail and lose our carriers we destroy our ability to fight them at all as soon as the second wave returns we will withdraw
0,if we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots we destroy their ability to operate in the pacific for at least a year
0,the second wave has not returned and we have no idea where their carriers are what is the damage report
0,we have achieved complete surprise the first wave is returning the second is attacking now and we have lost only a few planes we can launch a third wave admiral
0,we must go ahead this is our moment
0,we have a fighter screen up in case we are attacked admiral
0,we have achieved surprise but their carriers are not in port i dont like this
0,a brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war
0,brilliant admiral
0,set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the americans will intercept concerning every potential american target in the pacific include hawaii the clutter will be more confusing that way
0,if we achieve surprise they will offer little resistance
0,everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us
0,i have arranged a live fire drill with your permission
0,uncharged torpedoes have different balance
0,god help them
0,the chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the jap patrols do if any of the planes make it
0,so those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel
0,thereve been some complications sir the chinese didnt receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set and the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway
0,have the planes made it to china
0,we have bombed tokyo mr president radio tokyo interrupted its own broadcast to make the announcement
0,weve done studies were confident we would turn them back eventuallyafter theyd gotten as far as chicago
0,what if the japanese did invade
0,crank her
0,i havena been able ta
0,fook ya dooble
0,learn english then
0,fook ya
0,and if you dont give me a plane that can handle combat you better start learning to speak german
0,if yed wanted a bloody cadillac ya shoulda stayed in the bloody states
0,all of em
0,well which of those three ya want fixed
0,the struts are loose the hydraulics are leaking and the electrical systems shorting out in the cockpit
0,leapin jesus
0,the americans themselves have made it possible we will annihilate them in a single attack at pearl harbor
0,you see us as capable of such a blow
0,the council knows i have opposed fighting the americans no matter how great our resolve they have resources beyond ours if we must go to war there is only one way deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover in that time we can conquer all of the pacific and they will have no choice but to ask for peace
0,you have something to say yamamoto
0,the time has come to strike or to sit and let the americans cut off our oil and our future i know what you whisper to the others yamamoto that the americans are strong yet look at their leader
0,if knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then i have misunderstood what it means to be japanese
0,so you join us admiral some of us thought your education at an american university would make you too weak to fight the americans
0,its her 18th birthday i want to show her off

0,a regular allamerican guy
0,you didnt look then the way you look now
0,its possible i was infected with the hiv virus at that time but i wasnt diagnosed until several years later
0,obviously at this time you werent sick
0,possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law a razor sharp litigator a genuine leader gifted at bringing out the very best in others an awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues courtrooms the person on the street the kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesnt sweat but underneath the elegant surface was an adventurous spirit

0,joe from the day i arrived to the day they fired me i performed consistently thoroughly and with absolute excellence and if they hadnt fired me thats what id be doing today
0,okay okay they discover you have this horrible disgusting terminal illness and they panic for any number of perfectly valid reasons theyre frightened for themselves their families maybe its the homo angle maybe they dont want to rub elbows with someone whos just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne and how do they explain your status to the client for chrissake
0,the law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated so long as they can perform the duties required by their position
0,as in the vegetable

0,defined by websters as harmless
0,innocuous
0,your honor i submit there were no complaints until counselor began knocking on doors drumming up business and the dust which counselor refers to has appeared on only three occasions each time it has been examined and the results
0,your honor since rockwell corp began construction the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foulsmelling germcarrying pestilent dust my client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage
0,get down to word processing help jamey look

0,by the time i was fired there were four lesions on my face much bigger
0,one here in front of my ear
0,do you have any lesions on your face at this time
0,absolutely
0,and its your contention that when the partners were made aware of the lesions they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you
0,thats right
0,youve testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with correct
0,yes
0,really
0,miguel has not been infected as i said we werent aware of aids then or how it is spread
0,you could have infected him isnt that right
0,yes
0,isnt it true you have spent your life pretending to be something youre not so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you
0,in some situations
0,as a homosexual one is often forced to conceal ones sexuality is that right
0,some do i didnt
0,do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks
0,no
0,did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk
0,that is unotu correct i never lied about it
0,while you were employed at wyant wheeler you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual correct
0,no
0,do you need a break
0,id heard of usomethingu the gay plague gay cancer but we didnt know how you could get it or that it could kill you
0,youd uheardu of aids in 1984 85
1,that happened once people werent talking about aids then the way we are now or safe sex
1,but you uwereu having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985
0,its impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv
0,were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there called aids and that you could contract it through sexual activity
0,i guess it was 1984 85
0,when approximately what year did this event take place
0,yes
1,do men have sex with each other in that theater
0,yes
0,gay upornographicu movies
0,gay movies
0,what kind of movies do they show there
0,have you ever been to the apollo cinema on sansom street
0,not unnecessary ones
0,in general do you take risks in other areas of your life
0,in my work yes calculated risks you have to
0,do you take risks
0,something like that
0,you said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had an adventurous spirit is that correct
0,thanks mom dad
0,all i know is you got through your diagnosis fine like a trooper but when they fired you you were so devastated andy i dont expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus fight for your rights
0,mom
0,hes out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower
0,wheres dad
0,ancient how do you think i feel put that thing down and give me a hug andrew stop he still doesnt listen

0,are you on one of those conference calls i hate when you put me on hold
0,gillman says im fine my blood work is excellent tcells are up just a sec yes i think that would alleviate most of our concerns my platelets look good too
0,hold on mom theres no way my client will go along with that
0,whats dr gillman say
0,im fine
0,andy this is a nice surprise how are you hon
0,hi mom its me
0,hello
0,thank you
0,yes im now in charge of the paralegal department
0,were you recently promoted
0,yes
0,miss burton do you still work at wyant wheeler
0,objection
0,he was losing weight he looked kind of tired sometimes but he was working so hard still i felt something was wrong and i cant believe utheyreu saying they didnt notice anything
0,thank you no more questions
0,i said my earrings uareu american theyre africanamerican
0,what did you say
0,apparently mr wheeler felt they were too ethnic is the word she used she said he would like it if i wore something smaller less garish and more american
0,your earrings
0,well one time mr wheelers secretary lydia told me mr wheeler had a problem with my earrings
0,in what way
0,yes
0,no have you ever felt discriminated against at wyant wheeler
0,is that a question
0,ms burton youre black
0,your honor if mr beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair would the defense ask him to park it outside were talking about aids were talking about lesions lets useeu what were talking about
0,we object your honor it would unfairly influence the jury
0,ill withdraw it mr beckett were you living with miguel alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater
0,objection
0,ill withdraw you were aware when you worked with maria torres that she had aids correct
0,objection
0,ill rephrase did you have anything to do with this file being misplaced
0,objection
0,fact andrew beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level fact he made a grievous error on a multimillion dollar lawsuit fact he claims he is the victim of lies and deceit fact andrew beckett lied to his employers going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them fact he was successful in his duplicity the partners at wyant wheeler did unotu know andrew beckett had aids when they fired him
0,and when lawyers break the law when this society loses respect for the law when that day comes our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and grandchildren will live like savages
1,or unprotected sex with someone you didnt know very well any time during the last twelve years
0,uh no not really
1,unprotected sex with a prostitute
0,get real
0,a homosexual encounter
0,thanks doc but i dont need an aids test are you crazy but thanks for the information really
0,not by touching or shaking hands or hugging using the same toilet even kissing someone with aids is safe but it theres something in your past youre worried about
0,it doesnt travel through the air by breathing or touching right
0,right
0,the guy sat in my office you cant get aids that way right
0,you want to give me an aids utestu
0,joe i dont care a whit about your private life
0,why are we going to do that
0,were going to draw blood
0,yeah but doc isnt it true they keep finding out new things about this disease so you tell me today theres no danger and i go home and i hold my baby and six months from now i hear on the news whoops we were wrong you ucanu carry it on your clothes your skin and now ive got to worry about my kid what are you doing
0,leave that
0,right
0,the hiv virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids namely blood and semen
0,im not worried what are you doing
0,you had contact with someone who has aids and youre worried
0,since that time ive devoted more thought to the subject and thats how i feel now
0,five months ago you characterized andrew beckett as caviar and now youre calling him a cheeseburger your standards have shifted a great deal and id like to know why youve changed your mind
0,i might
0,its a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied a cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming do you agree
0,it satisfied me
0,did that thrill impress and overwhelm you
0,we won
0,okay mr laird explain this to me like im a four year old did andrew beckett win your lawsuit for you or not
0,i may have said something like that but thats not how i feel at this moment
0,according to the deposition you said you were thrilled impressed overwhelmed by the quality of andrew becketts work do you remember saying that
0,thats correct
0,mr laird when i approached you about being a witness at this trial and you agreed you gave sworn testimony in a deposition is that correct
0,we were satisfied
0,were you pleased with his work
0,thats correct
0,but andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit
0,wyant wheeler represented us
0,andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990 is that correct
0,people who want to bend the rules
0,what kind of people
0,sometimes it seems like society is urunu by these kinds of people
0,yes character to the extent that it affects a persons ability to do a great job
0,explain to me if you can mr wheeler explain this to me like im a ten yearold this trial is not about a disease is that what youre saying unotu about your understandable if unfounded fear of catching aids through casual contact with someone who has it youre saying this trial is about andrew becketts character am i getting this right
0,weve got a committee meeting
0,but hes got lots of other peoples lives to ruin
0,and i hate to rush you out of here but

0,owens
0,and there wasnt a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site uthatsu how they train you on a fucking simulator
0,when captain went down you stepped up whether you like it or not now they train you for this so

0,you were on a pilgrimage to new mecca
0,some prophet guy and a city man but he had to travel to the desert where there was quiet to hear the words of god
0,some prophet guy
0,you know who muhammad was
0,so quiet you get used to the sounds of the ship then
0,one of the christian habits we udidntu adopt perhaps unfortunately well have to wait
0,i dont suppose

0,what you dont really think they left with their clothes on the lines photos on the walls
0,doesnt need to be use this to get back up to the soltrack shipping lanes stick out a thumb youll get picked up right
0,not a starjumper
0,thats correct and you will both stand trial for heresy
0,seal the cave
0,well for a time the ancients kept humans as household pets	until the lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed keep digging cornelius youll find evidence of the master of this house an ape
0,no sir i havent forgotten
0,your conclusion is premature have you forgotten your scripture the thirteenth scroll and proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree and the children made sport of him
0,a doll alone proves nothing true but the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit
0,to begin with your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least there are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations
0,i apologize
0,dont speak to me in absolutes the evidence is contestable
0,indeed the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own some of the evidence is uncontestable
0,ive seen some of your fossils and artifacts theyre worthless
0,weve never meant to be treasonable sir but up there in the face of that cliff is a vast cave and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts
0,i ask you to reconsider the rash course youve taken if youre convicted of heresy the most youll get is two years but if you persist in pointing guns in my direction youll hang for high treason
0,it wasnt difficult only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the forbidden zone i see you brought along the female of your species i didnt realize a man could be monogamous
0,how did you know wed come here
0,yes sir so it was thanks to you but not before i discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written
0,he exceeded his orders his travel permit was promptly revoked
0,certainly sir its a pleasure to see you again
0,you know dr maximus our commissioner for animal affairs
0,oh no sir i was just assembling my notes
0,did you forget our appointment cornelius
0,dr zaius
0,certainly sir ill get my notes and come right over
0,cornelius if you have a moment today id like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail
0,good luck then
0,they cant convict us of that you proved our innocence besides his culture is our culture
0,and now you know the truth cornelius has beaten you doctor he proved it man preceded you here you owe him your science your language whatever knowledge you have
0,that was different we thought you were inferior
0,reconstructing a life care to have a look
0,what are you doing there
0,yes i have to agree from all youve found so far his positions as good as yours
0,no you saved me from this fanatic maybe i can pay you back
0,taylor id rather you
0,shut up
0,taylor youre not in command here put down that gun
0,if theres any shooting dr zaius youll be the first to die depend on it
0,right now if you like
0,when are you going to show me whats in the cave
0,no one really knows its an ancient taboo set forth in the sacred scrolls the lawgiver pronounced the area deadly
0,youve never told me why this regions called the forbidden zone
0,it empties into a sea some miles from here thats where the cave is
0,where does the river lead
0,i know nevertheless i thank you for saving us youll be in trouble for going there
0,sorry taylor the terrain around that lake is poisonous there is no fresh water no vegetation nothing
0,nothing much the remnants of a life raft maybe a small flag the emblem of my countrymen
0,its a long detour to dead lake what would we find
0,you still dont believe me do you
0,to the diggings i worked at a year ago its a three day ride across the eastern desert near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours
0,zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the forbidden zone thats what well try for what about you
0,as you wish
0,just the same i want one
0,the best but we wont need them
0,do you have any weapons
0,well taylor were all fugitives now
0,right lets put the water and provisions in the wagon
0,wed better get started if the mounted police pick up our trail theyll come this far at least
0,there was one bad moment some hunters stopped us
0,how did it go
0,zira
0,a toy it floats on the air try it
0,zira listen to me weve got a fine future ahead of us marriage stimulating careers im up for a raise
0,oh cornelius show some strength
0,no thank you i wont get into that battle
0,well maybe theyre not
0,because if he is a missing link it means the sacred scrolls arent worth their parchment
0,i am not a missing link
0,how can scientific truth be heresy what if taylor is exactly the proof you needed a mutation a missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape
0,that was before dr zaius and half the academy said the idea was heresy
0,you didnt think so then
0,the evidence was very meager
0,that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate possibly man in his trip to the forbidden zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time
0,its probably wrong
0,cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis
0,no they wont
0,dont be foolish if its true theyll have to accept it
0,zira are you trying to get my head cut off
0,but what about your theory the existence of someone like taylor might prove it
0,i dont and im not going to try
0,then how do you account for me
0,no creature can survive in that part of the forbidden zone ive been there ive seen it
0,cornelius why do you insist on provoking him
0,and even if it werent why fly where would it get you
0,flight is a scientific impossibility
0,and they fell out of the sky with you
0,dodge was killed in the hunt what happened to landon i dont know
0,oh cornelius be quiet
0,now just a minute
0,where did you learn to do this
0,dear youre a scientist dont you believe your own eyes
0,its a stunt humans dont write
0,zira come on you know they cant oh oh here comes number one
0,the blood transfusion
0,remembers what
0,look she remembers
0,watch hello bright eyes hows our throat today
0,whats so special about him
0,thats bright eyes the one i was telling you about
0,neither do i
0,no
0,do you have to work tonight
0,blessed are the vegetarians
0,well at least they havent tried to bite us
0,lets find them all
0,where theres one theres another and another and another
0,youre more than three hundred light years from your precious planet your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries even if you could get back theyd think you were something that fell out of a tree
0,taylor quit riding him
0,none at all
0,any particular reason
0,that way
0,which direction
0,okay if theres no life here weve got just seventytwo hours to find it thats when the groceries run out
0,no
0,any sign of dangerous ionization
0,nothing will grow here theres just a trace of hydrocarbons and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates
0,good question landon check your communications kit
0,but how long is a day
0,one pistol twentyfour rounds of ammo two medical kits one camera one tx9 weve enough food and water for three days
0,yo
0,geiger counter
0,yo
0,got your sensors
0,theyre still dirty and their bite is septic look at that
0,the foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here in studies of cerebral function in these animals
0,hmph
0,thats because dr zaius realizes our work has value
0,you do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment
0,what do you mean made it im an animal psychologist thats all we dont have any authority
0,but the quota systems been abolished you made it why cant i
0,these animals are dirty doctor they stink and they carry communicable diseases why arent they cleaned up before theyre brought here
0,this place is dirty doctor
0,i dont know this beast lost a lot of blood
0,will he live
0,him
0,which one was wearing the strange clothes
0,be it so ordered the tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question this hearing is adjourned
0,yes sir the state charges doctors zira and cornelius with contempt of this tribunal malicious mischief and scientific heresy
0,sustained
0,objection
0,sustained your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature
0,objection these remarks are profane and irrelevant
0,very well i suggest we go and look at them
0,thats true dr zaius my witnesses correction my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater
0,proceed but dont turn this hearing into a farce
0,he can reason with the tribunals permission let me expose this hoax by direct examination
0,directly mr president this wretched man the accused is only a pawn in the conspiracy we know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture the state charges that dr zira and a corrupt surgeon named galen experimented on this wounded animal tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster
0,come to the point dr honorius
0,there is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our faith
0,learned judges my case is simple it is based on our first article of faith that the almighty created the ape in his own image that he gave him a soul and a mind that he set him apart from the beasts of the jungle and made him the lord of the planet
0,state your case mr prosecutor
0,well dr zira this is a man is he not
0,objection the accused is indeed a man therefore he has no rights under ape law
0,show this to the president
0,ridiculous that answer is a contradiction in terms tell us bright eyes why do men have no souls what is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain
0,some apes it seems are more equal than others
0,of course he doesnt know our culture because he cannot think tell us why all apes are created equal
0,i admit i know nothing of your culture
0,tell the court bright eyes what is the second article of faith
0,do as i say
0,hes vicious doctor besides its against the rules
0,get me a collar and leash im taking him to the infirmary
0,ill see
0,those fools and their torches do you have any ointment
0,what happened
0,well you know what they say human see human do
0,hes trying to form words
0,huh
0,did you see that its remarkable
0,see he keeps pretending he can talk
0,awww it still hurts doesnt it
0,dont be silly hes perfectly tame
0,you could get hurt doing that doctor
0,no change the minute you open the door he goes into his act
0,good morning julius hows our patient today
0,good morning dr zira
0,youre our optimist look at the bright side if thats the best there is around here in six months well be running this planet
0,we got off at the wrong stop
0,try telling them our names
0,no cigar
0,okay
0,can we take a dip
0,lets take a look
0,scarecrows
0,id like to know why not you thought life on earth was meaningless you despised people so what did you do you ran away
0,but im not prepared to die
0,dodge hes not like me at all but he makes sense held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew i understand why hes here but youyoure no seeker youre negative
0,dont bother
0,okay you read me well enough why cant i read you
0,oh and one last item immortality you wanted to go on forever well you damn near made it except for dodge and me youve lived longer than anybody and with stewart dead it looks like were the last of the strain you got what you wanted kid how does it taste
0,taylor	im telling you
0,and the glory dont forget that theres a lifesized bronze statue of you somewhere its probably turned green by now and nobody can read the name plate but never let it be said we forget our heroes
0,climb off me will you
0,straighten me out on something why did you come along at all you volunteered why ill tell you they nominated you for the big one and you couldnt turn it down not without losing your allamerican standing
0,im prepared to die
0,theres only one reality left were here and its now you get ahold of that and hang on tight or you might as well be dead
0,all right
0,what would you learn ive told you where you are and when you are
0,if only we could get a fix
0,its a fact landon buy it youll sleep better
0,prove it if we cant get back its still just a theory
0,because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for theyre dust
0,long pause you know it
0,apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man whos two thousand and thirty one years old i read the clocks they bear out hassleins hypothesis weve been away from earth for two thousand years give or take a decade still cant accept it huh
0,by our time youve turned gray
0,then weve been away from earth for eighteen months
0,its a little late for a wake shes been dead nearly a year
0,you dont seem very cut up about it
0,air leak died in her sleep
0,sorry i was thinking of stewart what dyou suppose happened
0,landon join the expedition
0,were some three hundred and twenty light years from earth on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of orion that could be bellatrix
0,well where are we have any notion skipper
0,were here to stay
0,gone
0,forget it abandon ship
0,its no use there she goes
0,to earth that weve landed
0,what signal
0,landon send a last signal
0,the flags of discontent its the only way anything ever gets changed dont try to follow us im pretty handy with things like this
0,what
0,thats the boy keep em flying
0,i think youre making a mistake
0,lucius
0,ill start by following the shoreline and my nose
0,they think youre behaving foolishly i must say i agree where will you go
0,yes i can do that
0,i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner
0,what is it
0,all right all right will you do me a favor no orders
0,disillusioned but vindicated ive been right all along you cant trust the older generation its a matter of values
0,not everything they left a hostage how do you feel lucius
0,relax youll see it all later
0,always giving orders just like every other adult
0,sorry lucius youll have to stay here and guard the horses
0,in my world before i left it only youngsters of your age wore un scraped hair
0,why did you do that scrape off your hair
0,im for that
0,shouldnt we be moving on
0,fine just let her out
0,if you insist but im not taking any orders
0,i want her
0,zira doesnt want your female
0,she comes along too
0,come on get me out of here
0,so you can talk im dr ziras nephew this abduction was her idea youre not really going to the zoo thats just our cover story in case were stopped although i do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property
0,who are you
0,to scare off humans
0,the hunt club
0,who put them up
0,keep moving we cant turn back now
0,gorilla hunters
0,all right get inhurry put this on
0,he wouldnt leave her
0,i told you not to bring the other one
0,at the very least this man has the right to know whether theres a charge against him
0,and our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast and determine whats to be done with him
0,my own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation
0,you asked for the opportunity to present your case surely you must know why youre here
0,were conducting a new experiment
0,why special
0,yes sir but this creature is a special case
0,i know its a man and you know the rules no animals outside the compound and most certainly not without a leash
0,a man dr maximus
0,what is that
0,bailiff stop this outburst gag that monstrosity
0,you destroyed his memory his mind his identity and you want to do the same to me
0,dr zira silence that man
0,one is in a museum
0,bailiff make the animal be quiet
0,this hearing is absurd let me tell my story
0,it says here that his name is bright eyes you gave him that name yourself
0,my name is taylor
0,dr zira tell bright eyes to sit down
0,sustain all objections but face the truth
0,sustained
0,let us assume as common sense dictates that the prisoners story is false but if he does not come from another planet then surely he sprang from our own yes sprang as an animal psychologist i have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute
0,how so
0,is it a joke to seek the truth about this man
0,this is a joke in very poor taste
0,stop right there bring me that paper
0,i have come to you from a planet in a different solar system i am an explorer in space with no hostile intentions against your civilization on my planet it was the primate man who evolved into a thinking animal while the apes remained
0,read it yourself
0,since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense he asks that this statement be read into the record
0,did we create his mind too not only can this man speak he can write he can reason
0,mind your tongue madame
0,thatõs a lie
0,then why is he called the accused your honors must think him guilty of something
0,sustained in all fairness dr zira you must admit the accused is a nonape and therefore has no rights under ape law
0,by your leave mr president the tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry
0,let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the tribunal you may proceed dr honorius
0,dont look for it taylor you may not like what you find
0,were back at the beginning i still dont know the why a planet where apes evolved from men a world turned wrong side up a puzzle with one piece missing
0,the forbidden zone was once a paradise your breed made a desert of it ages ago
0,what evidence no weapons were found in the cave
0,because you are a man and you were right i have always known about man from the evidence i believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy his emotions must rule his brain he must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him even himself
0,why from the first ive terrified you doctor and in spite of every sign that im an intelligent being who means no harm you continue to hate and fear me why
0,no thanks ill take freedom
0,where else but in a cage does man belong
0,sure	in a cage
0,of course you could return with us our society might find a place for you and your mate
0,then there is another jungle
0,he might have been wiped out by a plague natural catastrophe like a fiery storm of meteors from the looks of this part of your planet id say that was a fair bet
0,then answer this if ran was superior why didnt he survive
0,cease fire withdraw
0,tell him to pull back
0,thats lunacy i can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects thats equally as inventive as yours but it would be conjecture not proof
0,i dont say he was a man like an earthman but id call him a close relative for he was plagued by most of mans ills yet fragile as he was he came before you and was superior to you
0,okayup to the cave
0,of course
0,very well if zira and cornelius can prove that those scrolls dont tell the whole truth of your history if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past will you exonerate them
0,twelve hundred years ago
0,when were the sacred scrolls written
0,what is your proposal
0,all right lets see if youre willing to put that statement to a test
0,there is no contradiction between faith and science true science
0,dont be a fool youre outnumbered and outgunned
0,stop right there
0,youre a menace a walking pestilence i do know who you are taylor as i know that others of your kind must live in the forbidden zone you have just six hours to make a full confession after that ill employ surgery to obtain one guards
0,im not protecting anybody that hearing was a farce what have i done
0,if you are protecting others of your kind it will cost you your identity
0,i dont know
0,you may well call it upside down since you occupy its lowest level and deservedly the eastern desert has never been explored because weve always assumed that no life can exist there save yourself taylor tell me is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone
0,thank you for calling me taylor dr zaius i know who i am who are you how did this upside down civilization ever get started
0,i admit that where theres one mutant theres probably another and another a nest of them wheres your nest taylor where are your women
0,then you admit
0,because youre not unique there was the one you call landon
0,all right suppose i am a mutant why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic
0,of course
0,thats exactly what zira and cornelius claim youre talking heresy doctor
0,certainly not	youre a mutant
0,i take it you dont believe the prosecutors charge that im a monster created by dr zira
0,a fort unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent where were you nurtured
0,what about it
0,then how is it we speak the same language even in your lies some truth slips through that mythical community youre supposed to come from fort wayne
0,my tribe as you call it lives on another planet in a distant solar system
0,you lied where is your tribe
0,i told the truth at that hearingof yours
0,however its within my power to grant you a reprieve that is why i summoned you here tonight tell me who and what you really are and where you come from and no veterinary will touch you
0,emasculation to begin with then experimental surgery on the speech centers on the brain ultimately a kind of living death
0,no
0,oh your case was preordained in a way you performed a service for the state because your hearing made it possible for us to expose zira and cornelius and now the tribunal has placed you in my custody forfinal disposition do you know what that means
0,what about me
0,identify him then speak to him
0,with one of them
0,welldo you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures
0,god bless you
0,go with god taylor thats an old expression it comes from both ape and man
0,all right but youre so damned ugly
0,dr zira id like to kiss you goodbye
0,its better than going to prison for heresy
0,we cant
0,would you like to come along
0,wasnt i humiliated by all of you didnt you lead me around on a leash
0,its humiliating
0,why not
0,taylor please dont treat him that way
0,taylor you cant
0,then tell them dr zaius wont leave here alive
0,he has a point on my planet children often play with ape dolls
0,taylor tell him
0,except that hes also the chief defender of the faith
0,taylor please
0,and thats your minister of science honor bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge
0,shes not sick at all shes pregnant
0,whats the diagnosis doctor a touch of the sun
0,you threw us together remember and you guessed right men like apes get despondent without a mate
0,you want her that much
0,maybe not
0,actually youre a different breed this creature will never evolve
0,yes
0,are you going to take her with you
0,youre going back to the forbidden zone
0,cornelius and i have been indicted for heresy unless we can prove our theories we dont stand a chance of acquittal
0,taylor just keep quiet and we may get away with this remember that men all look alike to most apes
0,listen
0,you did this to him youve removed his frontal lobes
0,no i swear i never saw this man before
0,you you knew about this
0,second from the left
0,which one
0,its himlandon
0,a hearing
0,what is this
0,shhhh
0,where have you been why didnt you come to see me
0,dr zaius i could have sworn he was answering you
0,im not acting i can talk how much proof do you want
0,there can you believe it i looks like hes talking
0,my name isnt bright eyes its taylor
0,speak go on	speak again
0,listen listen i can speak
0,well bright eyes is our throat feeling better
0,in a few minutes there will be no doll there cant be im sorry
0,but the proof the doll
0,he wont survive do you know what sort of life awaits you out there taylor that of an animal if you arent eventually hunted down and killed by apes some jungle beast will devour you
0,but suppose you find nothing but a wasteland how will you survive
0,what
0,but theres the doll sir
0,secondly if these tools as you call them are unidentified why are they introduced as evidence of anything
0,sirs our theories have a bearing on his identity
0,let them talk mr president let them talk
0,mr president i believe the prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with bright eyes
0,he doesnt know
0,how sad stuffed and mounted eh dead men like sunken ships can tell no stories and his other companion
0,where are they now
0,this is his assertion
0,but how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished you also state that bright eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture
0,like you i find it difficult
0,do you believe him
0,i do not state it sir the prisoner does
0,dr zira you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert
0,yes sir
0,wouldnt it more properly be done in your office
0,but perhaps he understood
0,of course he saw you moving yours
0,hes moving his fingers
1,kill you motherfucker
0,i shit on all o you
0,yeah back about 100 metres hes dead now get going the gooks are all over the fuckin place
0,hes dead where you saw him
0,elias is dead join up with the platoon move it
0,ill get him you get the man in taylor now or ill article 15 both your asses move

0,what your father did doesnt condemn you
0,so could you but our records were a little against us

0,including killainei still cant think of you that way
0,including killaine
0,funny i never thought of you that way you were so close too we were all pretty stupid about you
0,thats right
0,i thought you had to be back to the hotel to leave mymy note
0,that and the fun of it
0,if youre doing all this just for me
0,wonder what
0,i decided i didnt want a drinkim beginning to wonder

0,my father died in jail and he was twice the man i am
0,you wouldnt like it ive been there

0,its the frame on the picture but not if you say so
0,do you have to leave the note
0,it did but it never paid off until now i ought to be back within an hour we cant leave until near dark anyway
0,this must have cost a fortune
0,youll be safe here i wont be long help yourself to anything you want the galleys through there you can make coffee if you like
0,the best interference runner weve got he thinks hes in love with youand hes a gentleman come here baby
0,killaine
0,if they had any reason to why make it tough for themselves why go to all that trouble heres an open book close it no reason to keep it open she was a nice girl anyway and perhaps she didnt kill him on purpose perhaps she didnt kill the other one you never know give her the benefit of the doubt leave her stay where she is close the book finis
0,but thats what im doing couldnt they think of that
0,blonde beautiful and sadand nowhere of course she might have run awayif she knew how and where to go she might have dyed her hair bleached it before probably and changed her name again but look at this note and look at her room in the hotel her stuff is all there hasnt a rag except what she stood up in you dont run away like that not if you are young and beautiful no chance
0,and betty mayfield
0,i run over to victoria play some golf with some people i know do it all the time thats why i have a cabin cruiser custom builtforty knots mr clark brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure member of six golf clubs broke 70 once on the shaughnessy heights course you have to be good to do that and if you look out of a front window of the empress hotel in victoria in a few hours you can look right down on mr brandons boat the valkyrie came alone sure he always comes alone mr brandons a rather lonely man
0,theyll look for you
0,this is the ace betty but not of spades theyll find out about the other they might know already and when they get this what would they look for where out there somewhere
0,i was tried for murdering my husband guilty the judge set the verdict aside there was one man on the jury but he was afraid they were all afraidof my fatherinlaw that man followed me last night he came from him of course my fatherinlaw will never give up never he promised me that so i came to vancouver bc as far away as i can get from north carolina and it happens all over again almost the same thing almost the same way do you wonder about this
0,how bad is the other thing the secret
0,take me where i havent the courage to take myself
0,yes ive never been very far from it for a long time will you do something for me
0,how bad is it bad enough for
0,that wasnt why i called you why did i hopewhen i hadnt any right to hope
0,theres a lot of water between vancouver and the usa this note is a suicide note after youre gone where would they look for you why would they look for you darkness and open water and a fast cabin cruiser and i have a pocket full of money and if i helped you id be committing a crime or so they tell me
0,wrote it in the waiting room of the hudson bay store with somebodys pekingese trying to climb into my lap perhaps youre right perhaps i didnt mean it all i know is that im licked
0,if you meant it you wouldnt show it to me betty or am i supposed to deliver it to dear inspector killaine

0,theyre going to arrest me
0,no percentage in that
0,i hated to go to that place i almost went to the police station instead
0,youre probably mistaken about that lets get together sand talk it over theres always a solution to these problems but it must be near the water quite near yes if you dont mind waiting
0,theres another manright outside the booth here i never saw him before
0,cant be too close for me right across the street from it suits me anything else listed
0,i dont think thats on the market anymore id like something much closer to the water

0,you were there when i last saw him
0,were 98 per cent certain mitchell was murdered there are a lot of reasons was he very drunk when you last saw him

0,it is
0,thats an evasion and you know it
0,you didnt ask a question you made a speech
0,please answer my question
0,miss mayfield the humor of the situation escapes me within 24 hours i shall know officially whether mitchell was murdered privately im quite sure of it now it happened in your room and you came to vancouver with him at any rate he made your hotel reservation and you arrived together here in this room he behaved nastily to you and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat a few hours later he was found dead on your balcony would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious
0,im sorry thats all there is
0,ill have to know a little more than that
0,i was born in new york city i grew up and here i am
0,you probably know the type you find them in hotels and resorts all over the world they always have clothes and money and usually have had three or four husbands they dress and enamel themselves with great care they worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes and they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like larry mitchell tell me about yourself miss mayfield

0,mitchell was too drunk
0,she didnt have to he could have climbed down from here
0,how could mitchell after that act he put on up here is it likely shed let him in
0,mitchell was killed down here how could clarendon get in to do it or margo for that matter

0,your concentrating too hard killaine what about margo west she had a motive i guess you know by this time whose gun it was
0,not if she knew she wouldnt be believed

0,the only answer i have for you
0,doesnt answer the question
0,youd be breaking the law
0,would that make me a heel
0,ive always thought you were a pretty nice guy brandon id like to go on thinking so if you tried to help her get away
0,that must hurt
0,i have a warrant for her arrest
0,a couple of hours
0,sure lets discuss betty mayfield how long since you saw her
0,could we discuss that some other time

0,mr mitchell
0,good afternoon mr campbell
0,he was very easy to hate if youll look in your mirror when you are in a better temper youll know why
0,nastiness youre nasty with words why wouldnt you be nasty with deeds once in a while you hated himand i know why
0,with what motive
0,you could have got in that room just as you got in here how do i know you didnt kill larry
0,how clumsy id never forgive myself good night my dear

0,he saw my face too
0,i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun you lied it was obvious
0,thats not enough
0,im a very observant man you had something in your bag this afternoon something that causes you to hold it in a particular way something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar you went out with mitchell none of us ever saw him again
0,sardonic if you will my dear bust nasty you lied about the gun
0,you nasty sardonic
0,and now that hes safe from all other women you can go on loving him
0,dont be a fool i loved him he wasnt worth it but i loved him
0,orsince one is a wellknown and respected guestone could go to the desk in the lobby and say miss mayfield seems to have lost her room keyhave you another they always have another

0,what do you want
0,i dont think you locked your door

0,itll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet
0,go live in a tent
0,i have an appointment with him right here right now
0,the joints not open mac whos brandon
0,im looking for mr brandon
0,a think wirebut very very strong lets get out of here
0,greer and goble in the call building san francisco just like you thoughttwo murders in two days different places different methods different people nothing connects them but a telephone number
0,and a motivewhich we havent got so this could all be a dream
0,you win inspector you win all along the line why didnt we think of brandon beforeor did we some of us yeah of course you did when a suspect thinks hes safe you go on letting him think hes safe wait for a mistake
0,did we ever really think it was suicide
0,no suicide
0,if she didntif luck was against himhe wipes the gun off reaches the wall up theredrops it on the chaise
0,and she did give him the chance the way it worked out
0,he could have tried if he was up there in the dark listening hed know when she came home know when she found mitchell dead know what she did about it if she telephoned hed probably hear that
0,how did he know hed get the chance he couldnt have arranged it
0,ive got to find a way to handle it openly like brandon
0,so
0,ive handled it mitchells handed it if i wipe it off no suicide if i take it out and lose it no suicide if i leave it hereno suicide
0,well what about it
0,this is the shell what about the gun
0,youve got a dead man on your hands like this
0,pretty big chance huh
0,you can find out the first part the second part you have to take a chance on
0,do i know that shes out of the room likely to be out of it for some time
0,you can find out
0,do i know who lives down there
0,assume there is something to hid i go to a lot of trouble what do i do what would you do
0,such as
0,exactly now im the killer and theres something i dont want you to know something that would destroy my comfortable life rob me of my friends my position
0,before i took the story and closed the case id want to know a lot more about these people id want to know just about everything about them
0,theyll probably believe you but theyll want to know what you were fighting about why mitchell had a gun youll tell them a simple story theyll pretend it sounds all right to them now youre headquarters how does it sound to you
0,if ive got any sense im going to call headquarters
0,youve got a dead man on your hands you killed jimeven if it wasnt murder what are you going to do about it
0,should be over there
0,wheres the shell
0,i think so
0,was that about the right angle
0,there wasnt any motivelets try out the act
0,maybe weve been pretty dumb
0,not too hard is it
0,somebody did it twice last night in the dark
0,thats pretty risky business inspector
0,market it seems to me thats a san francisco exchange
0,gigi huh sounds frenchone of those fancy ladies must have been very fancy if he scratched her phone number in gold
0,gg market oneeightfourtwo
0,i guess im just ballast around here
0,ill know when i find it
0,she didnt seem the type to lam outeven if she got the chance that stuff was all gone through last night anything special youre looking for inspector
0,ive always looked forward to it all right lets get him out of here and tidy up
0,right a clean deduction from observed facts theyve got to be simple once in a while inspector
0,so the wound and the shell give you the same answer
0,unless the gun was slanted up
0,so the shell ought to have gone over
0,this make of gun throws a shell backwards high and to the right the chaise is only about four feet from the wall
0,correct inspector a womans gun us 125 caliber ammunition in it it was on a table in there
0,pearlhandled 25 automatic uh no its a belgian gun 66 mm
0,its her room she only got to the hotel this afternoon with him i guess he took too much for granted heres the gun
0,ive met her
0,i supposed you knew her too inspector
0,they tell me hell be a great loss to the liquor trade this mayfield girl
0,i knew him he was easy to dislike poor chap
0,i hate to pull rank on you sergeant but once in a whilefor moral purposesyou might address me as inspector in moments of extreme desperation you might even call me sir
0,right
0,so it seems sergeant
0,you in charge here
0,you would still have planted information that clarendon knew about the gunand not as an accusation but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession very neat good morning mrs west
0,and if you didnt believe me
0,sure you didnt come here in person just to tell me about the gun you wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about mitchell if i believe you it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night
0,now youre being beastly
0,perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems
0,i dont understand

0,im afraid youre not very glad to see me margo
0,oh many things inertia stalin and the cold war a failure of nerve we took the seediest most inefficient fifth of the economy into state care paid out millions for it put the same old duffers in charge a new broom with very old bristles when the tories were returned i went and sat in the bm and wrote my little book on chartism
0,what went wrong
0,did he i left school and worked for the labour party my older brother george had just been killed in greece and hed been an active member i heroworshipped him he was 25 years old it was an exciting time for us those first couple of years after the war we thought the country was about to become a true democracy i can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time they feel betrayed they want to know what went wrong
0,didnt evelyn waugh say that the country under atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation
0,then i began to listen to what the welloff were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act a small minority thought that england was really theirs they had made it they owned it the rest the wage earners were foreigners outsiders intent on wrecking it all
0,yes
0,shall we go
0,well we were just
0,hello anyone for a walk tom isnt i can tell you
0,these are transcripts of various radio broadcasts including gaitskills the one they tried to stop you ought to have that

0,i do worry about susan have you known her long she hasnt mentioned you
0,i think youll do very well
0,youre kind to be so encouraging
0,if you like but dont be too modest james the citizens duty is to remember not necessarily to write books you are highly qualified youre a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history a genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you
0,so i can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseuri shall be fulfilling a citizens duty
0,thanks
0,here i am lecturing you have some pâté
0,if we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost everyone must have a memory everyone needs to be a historian in this country for example were in danger of losing hardwon freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present
0,history books are first onto the bonfires
0,to james i remember what it was i was going to say we were talking about forgetfulness the czech writer kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting
0,to ann
0,and id like you to call me ann
0,please do i was beginning to wonder who this mr penfield was
0,since you are a friend of my daughters i think im entitled to call you james dont you think
0,its fine thank you
0,my husband apologises for not joining us its not too cold for you mr penfield
0,good suez was a minefield for both parties
0,yes
0,i see are you a socialist mr penfield
0,well i am a great admirer of your work i read your books on chartism when i was still at school im a journalist not a historian there are questions of method and approach i wondered
0,it wasnt much more than a pot boilersuez was very important for our generation i didnt want it to be forgotten and thats why id like to be able to help you but really mr penfield i looked through my notes before you came theyre all very much out of date theres been so much published since i dont think im your man
0,what a shame
0,my first husband worked for the bbc i doubt if anyone there remembers him now just another long dead diligent administrator he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbcs independence during the suez crisis one of the few things he was passionate about i became involved too i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez then he died and i loots the will to write it by the time i was over his death other books had been published and it wasnt worth going on
0,he was delightful
0,hes a little unhappy i hope he wasnt a nuisance
0,tom daddy would like to see you in the garden and will you ask betty to bring us some coffee and remember to say please
0,its kind of you to see me
0,mr penfield i am sorry to have kept you
0,ill suggest it remember though were news not features it might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police anyway ill be back with this soon thanks

0,thank you
0,and youll join me in a sambucca
0,yes please
0,are you going to have coffee
0,id want to set out events as they happened the way i see it is this the british empire was an ideal it may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century but it wasnt totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some selfrespect which is what i think the conservatives were trying to do then theres the essential
0,good
0,no id want to
0,yesyoure not a socialist then
0,from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on suez
0,and some of that sorry

0,yes might remember youre here to talk to my mother
0,might
0,might
0,i might
0,look will you come on a walk with me tomorrow
0,hes all right the professor
0,no its a bit of a madhouse for some reason a lot of my mothers friends specialise in monologues
0,i havent seen much of you
0,well you should
0,i havent really thought about it
0,do you think shes invited you up for her sake or for mine
0,no we talked about history and siberian geese

0,you just might
0,i might see you in norfolk over the weekend
0,i bet thanks for the drink
0,in radio were different
0,i dont trust anyone thats what comes of working in television
0,you dont trust me
0,too late just my luck
0,two or three years ago i would have stayed and fucked you
0,me too
0,i have to be up early
0,why not stay
0,yes if you like call me at work
0,again
0,well you know
0,very thoughtful
0,i called you a taxi
0,who
0,damn theyre early
0,that must be rather nice in a way i mean you dont have any
0,both dead
0,it makes me weepy just to remember it so we were fine again and then she got married to matthew whos a womaniser and a bit of a yob but quite nice really makes tv commercials what about yours
0,how nice
0,mummy and i we were more like lovers really or sisters then a couple of years after daddy died and not long after i left oxford she started seeing various men and i was furious i really was upset i stopped going home i never phoned i went round telling everyone how awful her books were and she hardly seemed to notice and that made me angrier then i got a job i was interested in and i started to see lots of men and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand so i wrote her a long letter almost seven pages saying how sorry i was and how i was worried that we were drifting apart and do you know she wrote me a poem a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters
0,yes youre much too old to making a drama out of alienation or whatever you call it youve got to take responsibility for your own happiness thats what i think anyway
0,oh yes
0,i think youre exaggerating and if you arent you should jolly well change your job
0,no theres a fourth numbness you do everything right but you feel nothing either way
0,and youre at this third stage
0,everyone describes the same process at first it is exciting youre at the centre of the world as soon as anything happens youre the first to know about it and there are deadlines a dozen times a day even more and thats intimidating and exciting then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off your a clerk in a rather dowdy office theres none of the glamour of television or the penetration of serious journalism youre a processor of semiofficial news some people leave at this stage then if you hang on and especially if youre promoted you discover a new kind of pleasure youre pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts by the way you ca judge length ending a broadcast on the dot having everything run smoothly selecting a running order that makes sense knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do professionalism
0,my real father well he was a flashback
0,too bad what did your father do
0,good theory but i like my mother i have no aversions to what she does
0,you dont like flashbacks because your mothers a historian
0,really i thought those long flashbacks were extremely good
0,and the shape of it all it was sort ofshapeless
0,oh but he was terrific
0,and i didnt like that man
0,i couldnt bear for it to end
0,i think it went on rather too long
0,i thought it was tremendous
0,i quite liked it i wasnt as enthusiastic as everyone else
0,what did you think of that wadja film
0,no its all right i can get a cab night night
0,can i give you a lift
