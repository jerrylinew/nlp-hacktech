0,and thats what you were going to do in the valley
0,thats where life begins marshes sloughs tidepools he was fascinated by them you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs youd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty he made this city
0,havent the faintest idea
0,hollie was always fond of tidepools you know what he used to say about them
0,the coroners report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs

0,if you want to hire me i still have to know what you and mulwray were arguing about
0,hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune we were a lot closer than evelyn realized
0,i didnt realize you and hollis were so fond of each other
0,just find the girl mr gittes i think she is frightened and i happen to know hollis was fond of her id like to help her if i can

0,who said that gary cooper james stewart henry fonda huh
0,do like the soldier toto go away this land is cursed when youre here every day you feel like youre at the center of the universe it seems like nothing ever changes then you go away one year twoand when you come back everythings different the thread has broken you dont find those you were looking for your things no longer exist isnt that the caseyouve got to go away a long time for many many years before coming back and finding your people again the land where you were bornbut not now its impossible now youre blinder than i am
0,now i understand why the soldier went away just before the end thats right just one more night and the princess would have been his but she also could not have kept her promise andthat would have been terrible he would have died from it so instead for ninetynine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him
0,listen to this onethe commander says to the sergeant you remember that windmill that used to be there yes sir i remember the mills gone but the winds still there you remember the story of the soldier and the princess
0,it was probably meant to be like this each of us has a star to follow so now what are you thinking of doing
0,no and nobody knows where she is
0,did you ever see her again
0,toto sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing so its better to shut up its hot in here toto take me to the beach
0,they tell me you never go out never talk to anybody why
0,you re thinneryou can tell youve not been treated well
0,no nobody came
0,im here take it easy take it easy sit down sit down did she come
0,but whered you go toto
0,you were expecting her huh its a nasty business waiting by yourself in company its better nothen ill leave
0,no alfredo i was coming to help you
0,you werent expecting me
0,could bebut i dont like this business it smells fishy to me
0,just so alfredo there isnt any and if you buy a television set you can watch it at home without any fuss
0,toto are you pulling my leg or something how is it possible to see this television without film
0,no you mean right at the end alfredo thats right toto right at the end and dont ask me what it means if you figure it out let me know
0,i want to make you happy toto im going to tell you a story once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm basta one of the guards saw the kings daughter she was the loveliest of all and he immediately fell in love with her but what could a poor soldier do compared with a kings daughterone day he managed to meet her and told her he couldnt live without her the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony then in the end ill be yours christ the soldier ran off there and waited one day two days ten twentyevery night she looked out of her window but he never budged come rain wind snow never budged the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldnt hold them back he didnt even have the strength to sleep any more the princess kept watchand on the ninetyninth night the soldier got up picked up his chair and left
0,you see it s like i say you always have an answer for everything
0,heeey totooooo dont get pissed off with me now come here i dont know where the fuck i have to go and the next time be careful how you talk not to take credit away from the lord but if i had created the world in all modesty certain things would have come out better but unfortunately such was not the case
0,stop it ive had enough of your sermons you act as if you created the world
0,dont think about it toto dont even try with feelings theres nothing to understand
0,but why there must be some way to make her understand
0,i told you the blueeyed ones are the most difficult
0,theyre not my words john wayne said it in shepherd of the hills
0,what you say is wonderful but sad
0,eh lovewhat a mystery i understand you totothe ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful whatever you do you cant make friends with them eh theres nothing to be done about it the heavier a man is the deeper his footprints and if hes in love he suffers because he knows hes up a oneway street because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants
0,whats she like whats she like
0,yes its a girl i saw at the station
0,is there a womantell me the truth there is a woman
0,nothing theres nothing its all out of focus

0,yes
0,ive shown it so many times i know it by heart the first time i showed it in 1940 was the sunday my first wife died they kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldnt have to close down the movie house i only found out that night after the last show those are things you never forget so toto how are these home movies going

0,mr leland why didnt you go to europe with him he wanted you to he said to me just yesterday

0,do we stand for the same things that the chronicle stands for mr bernstein
0,sure theyre like anybody else they got work to do they do it only they happen to be the best men in the business
0,mr bernstein these men who are now with the enquirer who were with the chronicle until yesterday werent they just as devoted to the chronicle kind of paper as they are now to our kind of paper
0,whats the matter
0,yes
0,isnt it wonderful such a party
0,certainly not
0,do you mr leland
0,that looks pretty nice
0,sixtytwo thousand
0,you just made the paper over four times today mr kane thats all
0,charlie
0,wasted
0,its three hours and fifty minutes late but we did it
0,well be on the street soon charlie another ten minutes
0,who said anything about brooms
0,im not guaranteeing a thing mr bernstein you people work too fast for me talk about new brooms
0,but mr kane i meant
0,it is accepted mr carter with assurances of my deepest regard
0,ive been a newspaperman my whole life and i dont intend if its your intention that i should continue to be harassed by this this i warn you mr kane it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly but i would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted
0,thatll be all today mr carter youve been most understanding good day mr carter
0,but mr kane
0,really mr kane i cant see the function of a respectable newspaper
0,thats the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on mr carter right now i wish youd send your best man up to see mr silverstone have him tell mr silverstone if he doesnt produce his wife at once the enquirer will have him arrested have him tell mr silverstone hes a detective from the central office if mr silverstone asks to see his badge your man is to get indignant and call mr silverstone an anarchist loudly so that the neighbors can hear
0,its not our function to report the gossip of housewives if we were interested in that kind of thing mr kane we could fill the paper twice over daily
0,the chronicle doesnt say shes murdered mr carter it says the neighbors are getting suspicious
0,as a matter of fact we sent a man to the silverstone home yesterday afternoon our man even arrived before the chronicle reporter and theres no proof that the woman was murdered or even that shes dead
0,if the headline is big enough it makes the new big enough the murder of mrs harry silverstone
0,there is no news big enough
0,im still hungry brad lets go to rectors and get something decent the chronicle has a twocolumn headline mr carter why havent we
0,because were running a newspaper mr kane not a scandal sheet
0,im not criticizing mr carter but heres what i mean theres a front page story in the chronicle and a picture of a woman in brooklyn who is missing probably murdered a mrs harry silverstone why didnt the enquirer have that this morning
0,thats one of the things i think must be changed mr carter the news goes on for twentyfour hours a day
0,but a morning newspaper mr kane after all were practically closed twelve hours a day except for the business offices
0,im going to live right here as long as i have to
0,my little sanctum is at your disposal but i dont think i understand

0,im sure thats it
0,thank you i cant imagine how mrs kane came to make such a silly mistake the sedative dr wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle i suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her
0,the nurse has complete instructions but if you care to talk to me at any time i should be only too glad i shall be here in the morning
0,id rather mr kane withdrew without having to get the story published not that i care about him but id be better off that way and so would you mrs kane
0,you dont have to show me anything mr rogers i believe you
0,the story about him and miss alexander mrs kane
0,what story mr rogers
0,i think i understand mr rogers but i wonder if
0,im protecting myself every way i know how mrs kane this last week i finally found out how i can stop your husband from being elected if the people of this state learn what i found out this week he wouldnt have a chance to he couldnt be elected dog catcher well what im interested in is seeing that hes not elected i dont care whether they know what i know about him let him keep right on being the great noble moral champeen of the people just as long as

0,emily youre being a little unfair you know what i think of charles behavior about your personal lives
0,why should anyone vote for him hes made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them children to be told one thing one day something else the next as the whim seizes him and theyre supposed to be grateful and love and adore him because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars

0,youve made your point perfectly clear mr kane good day
0,im much obliged mr president for your concern about me however i happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the united states and i say that if this lease goes through the property of the people of the united states goes into the hands of
0,i understand that you have political ambitions unfortunately you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own
0,thanks
0,i know the facts mr kane and i happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean youre a man of great talents mr kane
0,its the only vein i know i tell the facts the way i see them and any man that knows that facts
0,i must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein mr kane
0,im not suggesting anything mr president ive come here to tell you that unless some action is taken promptly and you are the only one who can take it the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks
0,it is the unanimous opinion of my cabinent in which i concur that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the governement and the people you are not i hope suggesting that these interests are not indentical
0,you cant
0,mr kane how can i persuade you
0,if youre interested in what people say signor matisti i may be able to enlighten you a bit the newspapers for instance im an authority on what the papers will say signor matisti because i own eight of them between here and san francisco its all right dear signor matisti is going to listen to reason arent you maestro
0,but it is impossible i will be the laughingstock of the musical world people will say
0,your job isnt to give mrs kane your opinion of her talents youre supposed to train her voice nothing more
0,impossible impossible
0,youre right we did lose a million dollars last year
0,i happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday charles could i not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise this enquirer that is costing you one million dollars a year
0,on the other hand i am the publisher of the enquirer as such it is my duty ill let you in on a little secret it is also my pleasure to see to it that decent hardworking people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money mad pirates because god help them they have no one to look after their interests ill let you in on another little secret mr thatcher i think im the man to do it you see i have money and property
0,charles my time is too valuable for me
0,as charles foster kane who has 			eighty two thousand six hundred and thirtyone shares of metropolitan transfer you see i do have a rough idea of my holdings i sympathize with you charles foster kane is a dangerous scoundrel his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him you may if you can form such a committee put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars
0,the trouble is mr thatcher you dont realize youre talking to two people
0,theyre all part of your general attack your senseless attack on everything and everybody whos got more than ten cents in his pocket theyre
0,mr thatcher isnt everything ive been saying in the enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true
0,wont you step into my office mr thatcher
0,i came to see you charles about your about the enquirers campaign against the metropolitan transfer company

0,you see there hasnt been a true word
0,can you prove it isnt

0,hello charlie i didnt know we were speaking
0,hello brad
0,i couldnt possibly live on as little as that charlie well let the salary stay where it is
0,well youve been getting a pretty low salary here in new york it seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our chicago paper should get what hes worth
0,yes
0,you still want to be transferred to the other paper
0,hey brad ive been analyzed an awful lot tonight lets have another brandy
0,i know you will
0,she can leave me as a matter of fact ive already left her dont worry brad ill live
0,its simpler than that brad a society girl cant stand the gaff thats all other things are important to her social position what theyre saying on the front porches at southampton is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner
0,you want love on your own terms dont you charlie love according to your own rules and if anything goes wrong and youre hurt then the game stops and youve got to be soothed and nursed no matter what else is happening and no matter who else is hurt
0,nothing if she dosent love me
0,thats all right what are you going to do about emily
0,youre not going to like it in chicago they wind comes howling in from the lake and theres practically no opera season at all and the lord only knows whether theyve ever heard of lobster newburg
0,yes now will you let me go to chicago
0,are you finished
0,you talk about the people of the united states as though they belonged to you when you find out they dont think they are youll lose interest you talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty remember the working man you used to defend him quite a good deal well hes turning into something called organized labor and you dont like that at all and listen when your precious underprivileged really get together thats going to add up to something bigger than than your privilege and then i dont know what youll do sail away to a desert island probably and lord it over the monkeys
0,you almost convince me im just drunk enough to tell you the truth i have to be a little drunk for that because im a coward you know that thats why you keep me around you only associate with your inferiors charlie i guess thats why you ran away from emily because you cant stand the company of your equals you dont like to admit they exist the other big people in your world are dead i told you that
0,the personal note is all there is to it its all there ever is to it its all there every is to anything stupidity in our government complacency and selfsatisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong you cant fight those things impersonally theyre not impersonal crimes against people theyre being done by actual persons with actual names and positions and the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue brad that you debate and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers
0,theres no reason why this this savage personal note
0,you might have made the whole thing less personal
0,do you think the enquirer shouldnt have campaigned against the oil leases
0,she hasnt any friends left sine you started this oil business and she never sees you
0,why is she leaving me
0,sure i am she wants full custody of the child no matter what happens if you wont agree to that shell apply for a divorce regardless of the presidents wishes i cant tell her shes wrong because she isnt wrong
0,brad you are drunk
0,emilys going south next week with the child as far as anybodys to know its a holiday when they get back
0,she was going to leave you anyway
0,i dont think so brad weve just had word that the president is out of danger it seems i didnt kill him after all
0,shes going to leave you
0,all right
0,no that wont help besides you never get drunk i wanted to talk about you and emily
0,ill tell you what ill do brad ill get drunk too maybe thatll help
0,i want to be transferred to the new paper youve been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to thats not what i wanted to talk about
0,why brad
0,charlie its just no go we cant agree anymore i wish youd let me go to chicago
0,thats just a little promotion scheme nobody expects you mike will you try and get mr leland some coffee
0,first of all i will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the enquirer
0,ill get you some coffee
0,im drunk
0,whats wrong brad
0,first of all
0,go ahead
0,id like to talk to you about that
0,ive got to think of emily
0,what
0,i dont have to i run a newspaper with half a million readers and theyre getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast i cant help that besides they all know im married to his niece ive got to think of her
0,charlie now youre not making sense
0,what lesson not to expose fraud when i see it not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property run it the way i said reilly this afternoon a great man was assassinated
0,there are the people of the united states and they are blaming you oh i know it doesnt make any sense but at least you can learn a lesson from it
0,look out that window
0,oil belonging to the people of the united states was leased out for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks nobody can blame me because
0,charlie
0,theyre true everything i said witholding that veto was treason
0,youve said a lot of things about the president in the last few months
0,i said treason was a capital offense punishable by death
0,and that copy of the enquirer said the president should be killed
0,because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the enquirer in his pocket
0,yesterday morning you called the president a traitor what do you think that crowd is doing down there they think you murdered him
0,what do you mean by that
0,why not well nobodys a great man in your estimation until hes dead
0,why not
0,do you think youre the one who should call him a great man
0,yes
0,charlie
0,take dictation front page editorial this afternoon a great man was assassinated he was the president of the united states
0,youre wrong it does make a difference to you rectors brad come to think of it i dont blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent you wont miss anything it isnt much of a war besides they tell me there isnt a decent restaurant on the whole island
0,it doesnt make any difference about me but one of these days youre going to find out that all this charm of yours wont be enough
0,yes
0,charlie
0,you start tomorrow night richard carl in the spring chicken ill get us some girls you get tickets a drama critic gets them free you know rectors at seven
0,id like that
0,you dont want to be a war correspondent how about being a dramatic critic
0,good
0,i mean ive got a job for you
0,yes
0,say brad ive got an idea
0,and i do it because they do it and they do it its a vicious circle isnt it im going over to georgies brad you know georgie dont you
0,they do it only because you do
0,how would the enquirer look with no news about this nonexistent war with benton pulitzer and heart devoting twenty columns a day to it
0,charles i tell you there is no war theres a condition that should be remedied but between that and a
0,all right brad all right you dont have to be a war correspondent unless you want to id want to hello georgie
0,but there is no front charlie theres a very doubtful civil war besides i dont want the job
0,itll be our first foreign war in fifty years brad well cover it the way the hickville gazette covers the church social the names of everybody there what they wore what they ate who won the prizes who gave the prizes i tell you brad i envy you by bradford leland the enquirers special correspondent at the front im almost tempted
0,our readers are anyway i dont know about the rest of the country
0,well gentlemen are we going to war
0,its a good idea for a newspaper four hundred sixy thousand
0,the chronicle is a good newspaper
0,people are going to know whos responsible and theyre going to get the news the true news quickly and simply and entertainingly and no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news
0,thats the second sentence youve started with i
0,whatre you going to do charlie
0,ive changed the front page a little mr bernstein thats not enough theres something ive got to get into this paper besides pictures and print ive got to make the new york enquirer as important to new york as the gas in that light
0,a wasted day
0,its been a tough day
0,tired
0,what makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid something inflexible that people are supposed to pay two cents for
0,poor mr carter
0,i think its beginning to dawn on mr rogers that i mean what i say with mr rogers out of the way reilly i think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state well mr bernstein
0,rogers isnt even pretending he isnt just scared anymore hes sick frank norris told me last night he hasnt known rogers to be that worried in twentyfive years
0,it does seem too good to be true doesnt it mr bernstein
0,it was for twentyfive thousand dollars
0,oh yes the bonus
0,you made it out to him last week after he left for chicago
0,what check
0,mr leland sent back that check

0,ill sign those papers
0,hey nurse
0,sure mr leland ill be glad to
0,on your way out stop at a cigar store will you and send me up a couple of cigars
0,sure
0,i dont know he was disappointed in the world so he built one of his own an absolute monarchy it was something bigger than an opera house anyway nurse say ill tell you one thing you can do for me young fellow
0,that must have been love
0,i guess maybe im not as hard to see through as i think anyway i never even answered his letter maybe i should have i guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years he hadnt finished it when she left him he never finished it he never finished anything of course he built it for her
0,yes
0,well thats about all there is and im getting chills hey nurse five years ago he wrote from that place of his down south you know shangrila el dorado sloppy joes whats the name of that place you know all right xanadu i knew what it was all the time you caught on didnt you
0,he married for love thats why he did everything thats why he went into politics it seems we werent enough he wanted all the voters to love him too all he really wanted out of life was love thats charlies story its the story of how he lost it you see he just didnt have any to give he loved charlie kane of course very dearly and his mother i guess he always loved her as for emily well all i can tell you is emilys story as she told it to me which probably isnt fair theres supposed to be two sides to every story and i guess there are i guess theres more than two sides
0,was he in love
0,brief marriage ten years
0,i am in receipt of your favor of yesterday i beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that mrs whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of charles foster kane she has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget with assurances of the highest esteem
0,he knows the first mrs kane socially thats the answer we got
0,oh yes i know about mr rawlston
0,rawlston is my boss
0,david grobleski davis my dear rawlston
0,its a letter from her lawyers

0,i can remember everything thats my curse young man its the greatest curse thats ever been inflicted on the human race memory i was his oldest friend as far as i was concerned he behaved like swine maybe i wasnt his friend if i wasnt he never had one maybe i was what nowadays you call a stooge
0,maybe you could remember something that
0,never mind bernstein told you about the first days at the office didnt he well charlie was a bad newspaper man even then he entertained his readers but he never told them the truth
0,sorry mr leland
0,you dont happen to have a cigar do you ive got a young physician must remember to ask to see his license the odds are a hundred to one he hasnt got one who thinks im going to stop smoking i changed the subject didnt i dear dear what a disagreeable old man ive become you want to know what i think of charlie kane well i suppose he has some private sort of greatness but he kept it to himself he never gave himself away he never gave anything away he just left you a tip he had a generous mind i dont suppose anybody ever had so many opinions that was because he had the power to express them and charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it but he didnt believe in anything except charlie kane he never had a conviction in his life i guess he died without one that must have been pretty unpleasant of course a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death but we do know what were leaving we believe in something youre absolutely sure you havent got a cigar
0,mr leland you were

0,bunch of savages in this town hey caitlins in the back you might want to see if shes okay shes been back there a long time
0,who eats cock
0,ill read the book
0,all right but youre missing out chicks with dicks
0,i might be leaving early to go out with caitlin in which case youll have to close the store tonight
0,you want me to bring the vcr over here so we can watch this
0,in my absence try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns
0,youre a snake
0,no dont bring it up i dont want to think about that now let me enjoy this hour of bliss ill think about all of that later in the meantime nobody mentions the v word
0,hey what about veronica
0,this is my way of spitting water at life
0,what happened to title dictates behavior
0,watch the store while i go home and change
0,i feel so ineffectual is there anything i can do for you
0,she went home shes getting ready and were going out
0,wow youve had quite an evening
0,im not
0,youre kidding
0,shes not going to marry that guy she went home to tell her mother
0,what did she say
0,im not she just left
0,now i know youre lying
0,no im happy because caitlin came to see me
0,youre happy to get a fine
0,im happy
0,youre happy
0,because im happy
0,then why arent you like screaming at me right now
0,i swear i couldnt make this kind of hell up
0,youre lying
0,because im here
0,then how come you got the fine
0,as opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here
0,holy shit that girl
0,little girl maybe five years old
0,really
0,i dont you did
0,i thought you never sold cigarettes to kids
0,living proof
0,i didnt think they even enforced this
0,youre bullshitting
0,five hundred dollars
0,no way
0,i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor
0,i like to expand my horizons
0,and this is what you rented
0,hermaphroditic porn starlets with both organs you should see the box beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame
0,whatd you rent best of both worlds
0,get to work
0,i know im your hero
0,please get the hell out of here
0,i like to think im a master of my own destiny
0,youre a danger to both the dead and the living
0,if title dictated my behavior as a clerk serving the public i wouldnt be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy but i did so my point is that people dictate their own behavior hence even though im a clerk in this video store i choose to go rent videos at big choice agreed
0,what
0,and two to make a point title does not dictate behavior
0,jesus
0,two reasons one i hate when the people cant shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines
0,what the fuck did you do that for
0,not yet
0,thats stretching it youre not being asked to slay children or anything
0,exactly
0,the reasons you wont let me borrow your car is because i have a title and a job description and im supposed to follow it right
0,what
0,so your argument is that title dictates behavior
0,its going to have to do for now considering that its my car thats up for request can i help you
0,you know what i dont think i care for your rationale
0,theres a difference those were obligations obligations that could not have been met at any later date now renting videosthats just gratuitous not to mention illogical considering you work in a video store
0,i see so playing hockey and attending wakesthese practices are standard operating procedure
0,we are employees of quick stop convenience and rst video respectively as such we have certain responsibilities whichthough it may seem cruel and unusualdoes include manning our posts until closing
0,if you must
0,may i be blunt with you
0,let me borrow your car
0,can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time
0,you work in a video store
0,whats that for
0,you want to rent a movie
0,i want to rent a movie
0,why should i loan you my car
0,fine just lend me your car
0,i dont want to talk to you
0,let me borrow your car
0,just go go open the video store
0,so theyll put her back in its not like its gonna matter if she breaks something
0,her fucking body fell out
0,so the casket fell over big deal
0,does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose
0,i was just leaning on it it was an accident

0,im telling you it wasnt my fault
0,i cant fucking believe you
0,nobodys there its four oclock on a saturday how many people ever come to the store at four on a saturday
0,i cant help it at least when we were playing hockey outside i could see if anyone wanted to go in
0,listen to you

0,yeah like you said you know i guess everyone tries it sooner of later
0,what your dick
0,you know

0,an embarrassing way to die
0,an embolism in a pool
0,twentytwo same as us
0,she was pretty young hunhh
0,thanks for putting me in a tough spot youre a good friend

0,she meant nothing to you either until i told you she died
0,she meant nothing to you
0,if you go i go
0,dont be an asshole somebody has to stay with the store
0,but i love gatherings isnt it ironic
0,you hate people
0,im not missing whats probably going to be the social event of the season

0,because my exgirlfriend is getting married
0,why not
0,no
0,all of them
0,which ones
0,you know who i can do without i could do without the people in the video store
0,the women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date as if somewherebeyond all the other gallonsis a container of milk that wont go bad for like a decade
0,the milkmaids
0,the milkmaids
0,lets hear it
0,its not really anyone per se its more of separate groupings
0,how can you lie like that why dont you vent vent your frustration come on who pisses you off
0,there arent
0,liar tell me there arent customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis
0,what for they dont bother me if i dont bother them
0,you gotta loosen up my friend youd feel a hell of a lot better if youd rip into the occasional customer
0,im gonna hear it tomorrow
0,who cares that ladys an asshole everybody that comes in here is way too uptight this job would be great if it wasnt for the fucking customers
0,why do you do things like that you know shes going to come back and tell the boss
0,the jizzmoppers job is to clean up the booths afterward because practically everybody shoots a load against the window and i dont know if you know or not but cum leaves streaks if you dont clean it right away
0,can we talk about this later
0,think of the weirdest craziest shit youd like to see chicks do these chicks do it all they insert things into any opening in their body any opening hes led a very sheltered life
0,what kind of show
0,oh its great you step into this little booth and theres this window between you and this naked woman and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks
0,i guess not
0,nudie booth youve never been in a nudie booth
0,nudie booth
0,hes the guy in those nudiebooth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off
0,whats a jizzmopper
0,you know how much money the average jizzmopper make per hour
0,did you ever notice all the prices end in nine damn thats eerie
0,ill give him five more minutes then im calling the cops i dont need this man im not even supposed to be here today
0,its not like you laid the eggs yourself
0,he said it was important to have standards he said nobody has pride anymore
0,what did he say
0,i told him that and he yelled at me
0,why doesnt he just mix and match
0,obviously not look at all the cartons that didnt make the grade
0,the quest isnt going well
0,each egg has to be perfect
0,perfect dozen
0,he said he has to find a perfect dozen
0,whats he looking for
0,this guy is going through all of the eggs look
0,shes in here
0,wait
0,youll never believe what this unruly customer just said
0,all those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed casualties of a war they had nothing to do with all right lookyoure a roofer and some juicy government contract comes your way you got the wife and kids and the twostory in suburbiathis is a government contract which means all sorts of benefits all of a sudden these leftwing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a threemile radius you didnt ask for that you have no personal politics youre just trying to scrape out a living
0,all right so even if independent contractors are working on the death star why are you uneasy with its destruction
0,exactly in order to get it built quickly and quietly theyd hire anybody who could do the job do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main all they know is killing and white uniforms
0,not just imperials is what youre getting at
0,a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer ill bet there were independent contractors working on that thing plumbers aluminum siders roofers
0,so
0,the second time around it wasnt even finished yet they were still under construction
0,and the second time around
0,so when they blew it up no prob evil is punished
0,basically
0,well the thing is the first death star was manned by the imperial army storm troopers dignitariesthe only people onboard were imperials
0,and you figured it out
0,something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it i could never put my finger on itsomething just wasnt right
0,compliments of lando calrissian
0,and the second one was still being built when they blew it up
0,luke blew it up give credit where its due
0,now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it
0,yeah
0,so they build another death star right
0,theres more
0,you know what else i noticed in jedi
0,i think they were catholics
0,the only problem is that at no point in the series did i ever hear leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief
0,more or less
0,hence the empire was a fascist theocracy and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution
0,it would stand to reason yes
0,then wouldnt that logically mean that its a theocracy if the head of the empire is a priest of some sort then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion
0,yeah
0,now hes in charge of the empire the imperial government is under his control and the entire galaxy is under imperial rule
0,i guess
0,well hes like the pope for the dark side of the force hes a holy man a shaman kind of albeit an evil one
0,how do you mean
0,right the emperor now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure yes
0,the emperor
0,all right vaders boss
0,whats that
0,there was something else going on in jedi i never noticed it until today
0,empire had the better ending luke gets his hand cut off and finds out vaders his father han gets frozen and taken away by boba fett it ends on such a down note and thats lifea series of down endings all jedi had was a bunch of muppets
0,blasphemy
0,empire

0,ill do it on one condition i want to make sure shes okay
0,thats your option ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time in case you didnt know it youre crazy
0,im leaning toward no
0,you made your decision yet
0,well i dont know if
0,im not a violent man mr lowry not by nature anyhow but if you hurt liza in any way ill kill you does that seem honorable
0,it seemed like a possibility what about your intentions are they honorable
0,youre here because you figured i might show up
0,thats ironic because were here to protect her from you
0,you should think of me as liza suttons guardian angel
0,im not sure what you mean
0,i like that a gun to your head and you ask about your partner hes okay may have a headache for a few days are you here with honorable intentions
0,youre welcome wheres my partner
0,thank you
0,i want this box rigged with a beacon
0,its okay im game
0,i dont understand
0,in jerrys safety deposit box
0,you sound so sure
0,walters had nothing to do with your fathers murder
0,not a man ezekiel walters
0,i know the story a federal judge he denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial
0,it was my fathers kept it in his wallet he was murdered
0,you do recognize it then
0,whered you get it
0,so youll believe what i tell you next because i need to find jerry and i dont think i can do that without you
0,if this was a spy novel your next words would be something like i now know too much to live why are you telling me all this
0,belief is immaterial whats important is the truth its been my job to find jerry im very much responsible for him
0,i dont believe you
0,jerry is dangerous jerry has killed
0,im still listening
0,yes thats right
0,these things youre talking about you did them to jerry
0,umy dogu one i intend to put to sleep extrapolate from there
0,a dog
0,and what did i say
0,jerry told me he bit your nose
0,it was it was
0,missionary penance you talk about it like it was a religion
0,me i was a minor missionary a heretic really but where else could a redblooded american boy lie cheat steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the allhighs besides now im trying to pay my penance
0,if i had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it id arrest you right here
0,as in resulting in death we pushed the envelope until it wasnt even an envelope anymore
0,terminal
0,we experimented with hallucinogens we used electro shock to produce a vegetative state we conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation
0,i am impressed we used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card
0,as in ucatcher in the ryeu
0,mk ultra was terminated in 1973 but not the research it was renamed ex catcher
0,ask what you can do for your country that kind of thing
0,a vulgar pop term but yes take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin that was our goal
0,it was mind control umanchurianu ucandidateu kind of stuff right
0,years ago i worked for the cia in the mk ultra program are you familiar with it
0,truthll set you free im listening
0,what im about to tell you is partially documented the freedom of information act saw to that but much more of it isnt for reasons which will soon be regrettably clear im going to share secrets with you repeat any of it and youll simply bestow the title of paranoid upon yourself
0,please sit
0,fine what the hell is going on
0,if youre as impressed to see me as i am to see you youre very impressed indeed hows jerry feeling this morning
0,reeducating trained killers in the ways of polite society making sure the men whove gone over the edge wont hurt anyone that sort of thing
0,brain washing mind control that sort of thing
0,were very specialized
0,i didnt know the cia had psychiatrists
0,only on the football field
0,thats it i went to yale i hope you wont hold that against me
0,the truth shall make you free
0,veritas truth what is it they say about truth
0,a year ago i was leaving work late one night two guys tried to mug me it was horrible jerry came out of nowhere to my rescue then he started coming to see me couldve been a storybook if he wasnt crazy at first i did my beat to avoid him but theres something inside jerry and jerry made me see it uhe made meu usee himu that make sense
0,jerrys visits to your office why do you tolerate them why him
0,excuse me
0,a charming term now uwhy himu
0,honestly i think he has a crush on me
0,uwhy youu
0,im sorry what was the question again
0,heres a fresh one why you your colleague mr wilson says jerry wont speak to anyone else that seems oddly possessive behavior to me
0,youve asked me that one three times
0,and you have no idea where he lives
0,you already asked me that why do you insist on making me repeat myself
0,so he thinks nasa is plotting to kill the president
0,it was my dog let me ask you a question how long have you been acquainted with jerry
0,and you feel bad for it
0,you were going to ask about my nose the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today
0,excuse me
0,a dog bit it
0,can i ask you something
0,what do i look like to you switzerland
0,liza settle a bet for us
0,too bad because im terrible at yes
0,im not that good at no liza
0,look youre a nice guy but im not really dating right now
0,night after that
0,working
0,hmm how about tomorrow night
0,working
0,so you doing anything tonight
0,agent lowry
0,go ahead miss sutton
0,then this is a goddamn emergency
0,yes
0,do you uhaveu an agent lowry in your new york office
0,the office is closed for the evening is this an emergency
0,i need to speak with an agent lowry
0,federal bureau of investigation
0,what the hell does that mean
0,go to the northeast corner call a cab bring the pizza then theres a poem roses are red violets are blue if the pope goes to washington i would too
0,understood
0,ive had a lot of credentials flashed in my face liza what i saw yesterday i know not to ask questions were out shut off terminated uunderstoodu
0,we dont know who jonas is we dont know who it is were cooperating with
0,dr jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate why is that
0,i dont like it somethings wrong
0,it makes perfect sense field work is not our oeuvre
0,this doesnt make sense
0,ive been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to jerry fletcher were not to discuss him with the press the nypd anyone building police are to arrest him on sight and were to report any attempt he makes to contact you
0,i dont know if youre the best lawyer ive got or a high school sophomore
0,tell him im on vacation that i wont be back for two weeks
0,not today
0,ah your psychotic is here
0,i dont think so
0,that you come with me
0,what do you suggest
0,dont go home and dont go to work either one could be bad
0,im going to find him because hed find me
0,no idea honest what are you going to do
0,where do you think jerry is
0,jonas builds assassins for a living several of whom may be in place already wed like to kill a few birds with one stone
0,hes shown himself why havent you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do
0,hes why i watch jerry jerrys the bait for jonas
0,and jonas
0,im it really doesnt matter think cia and exponentiate im a government employee and ive been watching jerry for awhile
0,nothing i was just making sure so who are you
0,what gave me away
0,you think we have time to fool around like this come on
0,whos the deputy director of the fbi
0,what do you mean
0,i want to believe you too
0,yeah i do
0,do you believe me
0,go ahead well be right down
0,can i talk to you a second
0,your call have a good night
0,when im ready to compare notes ill let you know
0,its his show for now look you want to get some dinner inter agency cooperation and all
0,jonas
0,wasnt my idea
0,agent lowry
0,no not yet
0,youre welcome spooks so you want to compare notes on this guy
0,i was just thinking that
0,thats the book hinkley had on him when he shot reagan
0,i dont know didnt see him
0,which way did he go
0,you dont understand
0,guys a cia shrink here to id fletcher they knew each other somehow
0,wait
0,while we walk dc police want him for assault secret service for counterfeiting and were tracking him on a string of bank robberies no one knows what the cia wants him for
0,tell me about it
0,were waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up this guy fletchers something else
0,there is no abort procedure we dont know how we turned the damn thing on let alone how to turn it off
0,what
0,theres no plug to pull
0,pull the plug get her out of there
0,weve lost contact
0,ellie
0,we have benzel activation repeat we have benzel activation control to arroway you okay in there repeat control to arroway come back
0,anything happening in there el
0,im not sure we have no launch protocol the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation
0,what
0,i dont know ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology
0,you dont believe it to be tell me something doctor why do you think they would go to all this trouble bring you tens of thousands of light years and then send you home without a shred of proof sort of bad form wouldnt you say what was their intent
0,all the elements are there a woman orphaned young under a great deal of stress the failure of a project shes staked her selfworth and very sense of identity on induces a fantasy of reuniting with her father in heaven as it were is it possible
0,is it possible
0,dr arroway do you think its possible you had some kind of delusional episode
0,yes sir
0,he died in 1972
0,yes sir
0,and this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you as your father
0,its extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at
0,or youre our kind of people
0,its a hoax i knew it
0,what in the hell
0,how is that possible how could all that information be encoded in
0,hope theres a cartoon
0,okay fine theyve got the primes but if youre right about there being another more significant transmission still to come
0,mike because of the earths rotation were only in line with vega so many hours a day the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations if dr arroway hadnt moved quickly we could have lost key elements
0,dr arroway let me first say
0,michael kitz national security advisor
0,dr arroway
0,so there wasnt any clothes in the machine she was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the maytag listening
0,so
0,last week about 3 am fish dr fisher was on a late shift and he found her doing laundry
0,tell me
0,nothing okay some of us have been a little not concerned exactly but
0,still settling in really wheres dr arroway
0,glad to have you david hows the new office
0,now i remember why i went into theoretical work kent
0,for giving me a chance just for a moment to feel what it must be like to be you
0,thank you
0,nothing i guess i just wanted to thank you
0,what would you have me say david
0,ellie we both know that if i was any kind of a man i never wouldve entered this race that i would have told the president straight out helen eleanor arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass but shes got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together that more then anyone else on the planet shes earned this and that she should be the one to go because shes the best we have but thats not who i am i like to think its who i mightve been if things had gone a different way that i might have been worthy really worthy of what ive been given you do what you have to do and in the end as with everything it comes down to power and it isnt fair
0,good luck david
0,right well
0,this seemed best
0,you arent staying
0,maybe they are maybe this is all part of the package the building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale maybe requiring us to come together in this way was in effect part of the plan
0,they knew our level of development if as you say theyve done this many times theyd be well aware of the implications
0,i cant believe they wouldnt take something as basic as our biological needs into account
0,two years is still a hell of a long time and as far as we can tell there arent any provisions in the machine design for storing food water even air
0,excuse me im late for a meeting
0,you
0,as of three oclock this afternoon i submitted my resignation
0,what
0,ellie you should know that im no longer the presidents science advisor
0,im asking for your help david i want to go theyll need someone relatively young unattached and probably a scientist as the presidents science advisor you have enormous weight im asking if youll support my candidacy
0,i dont understand
0,david i know weve had our differences but ive always thought of you as a fair man even when weve disagreed and its in that light im hoping youll consider my request
0,itll just take a moment
0,actually im running late
0,do you have a minute
0,ellie
0,david
0,you were right ellie you were right all along
0,you mean
0,weve cracked it lunacharsky found it
0,what is it whats happened
0,interesting analogy and how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in africa
0,ms president this is communist paranoia right out of war of the worlds there is no reason whatsoever to believe the etis intentions are hostile we pose no threat to them it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in africa
0,its not a threat ellie its a fact if youre not careful you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly play ball really its good advice
0,are you threatening me
0,i want you to listen to me carefully the minute the implications of this message became clear this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one an extremely complex extremely volatile one there are forces at work here you dont understand i can help you up to a point but only up to a point
0,ellie
0,im going to convert mr scienceis therootofallevil this is absurd david we have work to do here i dont have time to play babysitter to the god squad
0,apparently hes genuinely interested in science this could be a chance to win him over
0,with me
0,the theological ramifications of all this are obvious the president feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them shes also named palmer joss as their liaison hes requested a meeting with you
0,what why
0,arrangements also have to be made for the vips coming in mostly religious leaders
0,rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise
0,throw a gray scale on it standard interpolation
0,you must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already
0,could it be a nested code of some sort
0,its hardly yesterday the signals been traveling for over twentysix years as for why im hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out to see if theres another message buried deeper in the signal
0,if its attention you want id say youve got it just one thing why vega everyones looked at vega for years with no results and now yesterday they start broadcasting primes why
0,mathematics is the only truly universal language senator we think this may be a beacon an announcement to get our attention
0,it was a worthy experiment worthy of you i was wrong about that part but its over now
0,david
0,then why havent you detected any signals if as you claim there have been thousands millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasnt one signal gotten through itll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through youre welcome to stay until then
0,goddamnit they are out there david
0,no youre not but the price has just gotten too high
0,the difference being what that i refuse to adopt the standard line that i dont care about the results of my work well i do care of course any discovery has to be verifiable of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method but i refuse to go around pretending im some kind of dispassionate automaton when its obvious to anyone with a brain im just not
0,the point is this isnt just scientific inquiry anymore its turned into some kind of personal obsession
0,im searching for patterns in the noise thats all order in the chaos im practicing listening
0,meaning i have to go defend a budget to the president and to congress and youre out here listening to washing machines
0,meaning
0,its not like youve given me much choice
0,you cant just pull the plug david
0,ellie i should have done this a long time ago certainly before i left the nsf but i wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt
0,its not enough having my search time systematically cut down you know im down to three hours a week now
0,you know why im here
0,did i tell you weve expanded the search spectrum were including several other possible magic frequencies not just the hydrogen line anymore i was trying to get inside their heads yknow and i started thinking what other constants are there in the universe besides hydrogen and then suddenly it was so obvious transcendantals right so weve been trying variations of pi
0,ellie
0,no doubt
0,now exactly its complicated
0,presidents science advisor so what you just spend all your time jetting around on air force one now
0,im surprised you even knew it was an election year
0,really congratulations by the way
0,very well since my appointment hes been made interim director
0,oh hows he doing
0,peter sends his regards
0,no thanks
0,pepsi tequila
0,then disagree but dont stand in my way
0,i disagree
0,what if youre wrong no ill grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence you cant deny the possibility and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly profound is worth investigation and worth taking a few risks
0,two theres nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and youd be wasting your time
0,youre
0,and only two probabilities one there is intelligent life in the universe but theyre so far away youll never contact it in your lifetime
0,dr drumlin we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity there are over four hundred billion stars out there
0,im not youre far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense
0,im willing to take that risk
0,im sorry miss arroway not only is it too speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation at this point in your career itd be tantamount to suicide
0,well
0,whats the status of the decryption effort
0,yes of course all im saying is this message was written in the language of science mathematics and was clearly intended to be received by scientists if it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush or a booming voice from the sky
0,mr ranks organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families dr arroway feel free to disagree but there wont be any suppressing of opinions here today
0,a transport so are they coming or are we going
0,and while its function remains for the moment a mystery my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind
0,how soon will you be able to decode it
0,because you cut it from the budget three years running
0,it could be anything the first volume of some encyclopedia galactica
0,what does it say
0,i dont know maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere but if there is i sure as hell cant find it
0,how can that be
0,no primer
0,and
0,weve repeated a few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one
0,what
0,maybe itll be at the end of the data when the message recycles
0,theres no way of knowing without a key a primer to help us maybe never
0,a third layer
0,in ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing it was called a palimpsest
0,what
0,analyzing signal polarization shifts
0,dr lunacharsky
0,norads not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops shuttle endeavors in sleep mode
0,hows the spying tonight guys
0,i scanned it at arecibo negative results always
0,that cant be right its only twentysix light years away
0,put it on speakers
0,hydrogen times pi got it strong sucker
0,im not sure you mind checking right ascension 18 hours 34 minutes declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes
0,got a bogey boss
0,vb10s an m dwarf signa draconis too old
0,been there done that got the tshirt
0,j39 z186
0,its incredibly rich weve been cataloging it in frames or pages right now were on 10413
0,i think we just hit the cosmic jackpot
0,its a civilian facility
0,cant we get rid of them
0,it cant be coming from vega the systems too young
0,okay lets just slow down pull up the starfield signal origin
0,thank you mr sensitive im coming at this wrong missing something something
0,youve only searched what is it sixteen hundred stars without a peep try not to take it too personally
0,never seen the optical sky myself but i hear its nice too
0,its beautiful
0,its how i hear it the displays just a little something i programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight
0,this is how you see the sky
0,here right around centaurus a
0,nice where
0,1 found a glitch in the timing probably a starquake
0,ellie pulsar
0,kent kent for chrissakes you must be eleanor
0,dr cullers
0,because i cant
0,so why dont you admit what by your own standards must be the truth that this experience simply didnt happen
0,but i dont believe it to be the truth
0,thank you doctor now
0,is it possible yes but
0,please answer the question doctor
0,by our standards yes
0,in fact by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible
0,i dont have the figures in front of me but yes that sounds about right
0,and current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes youre talking about even for a fraction of a second would require more energy than our sun produces in a year is that correct
0,there is no direct evidence no
0,i dont have an official response michael all i have are the same questions you have
0,is that your official response
0,i dont understand it all i can think is that maybe because the video gear wasnt accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design
0,thats terrific but theres one problem we dont have the means to receive all the data on our own
0,if at some later date the message proves harmless we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world but until then
0,pardon me but you cant do
0,and a hundred mile airspace
0,and a hundred mile airspace
0,colonel jarrod id like a twenty mile radiosilent perimeter put around this installation immediately
0,you dont seem to understand that its your interests im trying to protect
0,which well also need the networks help to receive and decode
0,you want to classify prime numbers
0,im saying you might have consulted us the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive
0,this isnt a person to person call mr kitz i dont really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for americans
0,ill come right to the point doctor your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of national security
0,childhood is over ellie its time to grow up
0,no please
0,its time to go home now
0,ellie this is the way its been done for billions of years
0,please if you downloaded everything about us you know the problems we face the impact it could have it could make the difference
0,no more stalling captain
0,but you said you wanted to help dont you see what it would mean
0,that isnt the way it works
0,but other people from our planet should see what ive seen they should witness this for themselves
0,eventually youll get here on your own this was just the first step in time youll take another
0,none taken but do we get to come back others of my kind i mean
0,if we dont engineer a consistent causality itll work itself out on its own and thats almost always worse ellie according to your physics none of this is possible a lot of it youre simply not capable of understanding not yet no offense
0,no i mean why so soon
0,now you go home
0,so what happens now
0,you always have been were all descendants of the same stars ellie all made of the same primordial atoms
0,all those voices you gather them all together millions of intelligences in one consciousness and now were a part of it
0,the librarian or the library
0,am i one or many
0,can you help us
0,life is unspeakably rare so whenever we do find another civilization especially one thats struggling we send a message sometimes we can offer help sometimes we cant but we always try life is simply too precious not to
0,you have your mothers hands there are no tests ellie we dont sit in judgment think of us more as librarians curators of the universes rarest and most valuable creation
0,so we passed some kind of test
0,not all some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams some never make it this far
0,the scale its just so all the civilizations you detect they all end up coming here
0,we dont know whoever they were they were gone long before we ever got here
0,so who
0,oh we didnt build it the transit system has been in place for billions of years were just its caretakers
0,and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built
0,many others
0,and those other docking ports i saw i mean there are others
0,you contacted us we were simply listening weve been listening for millions of years
0,why did you contact us
0,small moves captain small moves
0,can you show me
0,originally just another species like yourselves well not like you at all actually but
0,so who what are you
0,we thought this might make things a little easier
0,but youre so i mean how could you possibly when i was unconscious you downloaded my thoughts my memories even this beach ive never been here but i remember its how i always imagined pensacola
0,am i artifact or dream you might ask that about anything
0,so are you an hallucination or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin
0,thats my scientist
0,youre not real none of this is
0,dad but tell me how did i mean how can
0,im sorry i couldnt be there for you sweetheart
0,i used i used to dream you were alive and then id wake up and lose you all over again
0,okay
0,time to sleep now captain but you can ask more questions in the morning okay
0,thats a beauty captain now get some sleep
0,pensacola
0,okay okay there
0,mmm thats a good one maybe his echo okay no more stalling
0,could we hear god
0,big enough radio i dont see why not
0,could we hear to the moon
0,on that old shortwave maybe on a clear night come on now under the covers
0,could we hear to china
0,just be yourself captain find out where he is
0,but what do i say
0,talk to him
0,try again between the static and hey jude thats where theyre hiding
0,i cant move any smaller
0,small moves captain small moves
0,cant doctors orders the low oxygenzero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive its all right i like it here ever try sex in zerog
0,why dont you come back with me
0,of hadden industries
0,as each component was tested and shipped off to texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in hokkaido for backup purposes of course weve been right behind you the entire time you see my problem i couldnt appear to control too large a percentage my enemies wouldnt stand for it so i simply made sure the japanese consortium received the systems integration contract of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired whollyowned subsidiaries
0,mmm look closer
0,the systems integration site
0,hokkaido island
0,wouldnt you if you saw hitler on tv come i want to show you something
0,the gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us
0,i think whoever sent the message did it because theyre worried about us
0,you sound like joseph you think the world ends with the millennium
0,oh not quite yet at least for their sake i hope its not because theyre running out of time
0,what are you talking about its over
0,yes a shame still itd be worse if they died for nothing
0,it looks like pixie dust kent wouldve given anything to see this david too
0,japanese squid fleet they use lights to attract them to the surface then turn them into sushi
0,whats that
0,poor tired spinning girl how we feasted on her and now that weve had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap were pulling out thats paris where my daughter was born moscow where gangsters rule the night and i gave up smoking so many battles so many lives all that sturm and drang as if it never happened if it werent for a few power grids you wouldnt know we existed
0,its so small
0,a sunrise and a sunset every forty five minutes
0,thats my girl done
0,mr hadden im a scientist i dont make deals but if you wish to give me in good faith access to your information i can assure you that i will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesnt conflict with the best interests of science or my better judgment
0,in return you get the primer and with it the power to stay in the game do we have a deal
0,and in return
0,that would seem to be the question of the hour i want to build it doctor of course im already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption but as i said my colorful past has made many of those channels difficult to navigate i need someone on the inside
0,a machine but a machine that does what
0,very good doctor ive also detected structural elements back references a general movement from the simple to the complex all of which would seem to indicate instructions an enormously complicated set of instructions for building something
0,some kind of circuitry
0,even if he doesnt receive the entire transmission heaven is the mustard seed
0,youre saying there is no separate primer in the message because its on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is
0,not if you think like a vegan
0,a pagebreak signal a period
0,page after page of data over sixtythree thousand in all if im not mistaken and at the end of each
0,thats my girl lights
0,if i knew you any better id say that doesnt sound like you
0,ive had a long time to make enemies dr arroway there are many governments business interests even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear and i will grant them their wish soon enough but before i do i wish to make a small contribution a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet whove given from whom ive taken so much
0,youve found it what could i possibly have that you would want mr hadden
0,oh maybe not out but definitely looking for you coat i understand youve had some difficulty locating the what are you calling it the primer that will make decryption possible ive found it
0,i didnt realize i was out
0,the powers that be have been quite busy lately falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century if not the millennium perhaps youve noticed perhaps i could help deal you back in
0,what kind of deal
0,the infamous unfashionable bluntness youre here so we can do business i want to make a deal
0,why am i here mr hadden
0,i find it convenient to keep my interests mobile anyway ive had my fill of life on the ground after spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer after outliving three wives and two children i find ive had quite enough of planet earth
0,you live here
0,once upon a time i was a hell of an engineer please sit doctor i have guests so rarely its important to me they feel welcome in my home did you know this was once yeltsins flying dascha that dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot at least thats what the people who sold me the plane said
0,sr hadden you compromised our security codes
0,i think it is your naivete i like best about you eleanor oh therell be a worldwide protest but we all knew it from the very beginning you americans discovered the signal you led the decryption effort the machine is being built on your home soil of course the passenger will be an american chosen by americans anyway it is what the whole world wants no this is the big show the sort you put on better than anyone its good marketing its good casting its the american way
0,youre implying that the whole selection process is a sham
0,i do more than anything but i am also a realist soon this what is your charming term dog and pony show will finally be over and i will go home
0,i thought you were here because you want to go
0,perhaps but on the offchance that it is a doomsday device of some kind i plan to be very far away from your lovely texas when it is activated
0,id say this is slightly different
0,weve just lived through a century of incredible violence and self destruction do you call it interventionist when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck
0,very well assume this is true assume they have only the best of intentions suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us you have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs
0,but the machine worked thats what ive been trying to tell everyone the tape its all there if theyd just look at the tape
0,thats one way of putting it kitz the president the isc have shut down all official communications thereve also been reports of riots flaring up across the us and europe until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough especially for you
0,peter what is going on has everyone gone completely insane
0,how long was i gone
0,what day
0,peter what are you talking about what malfunction what day is this
0,its all right the important thing is youre safe
0,wait hold on a minute
0,thank god when we lost contact i thought we thought but youre okay were still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction did you notice anything at all that
0,im im fine
0,ellie are you okay
0,like it almost there
0,like it or not
0,that you valerian
0,its really happening
0,someone tell me this is really happening
0,you too
0,its good to see you ellie
0,peter
0,ellie
0,that is true but its also true that if i really thought we wanted the same things id follow you anywhere but the truth is i dont think you want the company be honest el theres nowhere youd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe and call me crazy but i just cant compete with that im sorry
0,you sonofabitch
0,ellie im getting married her names laura she came up to owens valley to do her postdoc about six months after you left
0,im serious about this peter
0,ellie
0,right now well drive down to ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us
0,jesus
0,and you think i dont want those things you think i dont stay up half the night wondering if ive made the right choice living half a world away from you wondering if any of this is worth what im giving up for it everyday lets get married
0,maybe thats the problem i want a family ellie i want kids a townhouse on l street instead of still living like a college kid a real life maybe that makes me a sellout but i dont care anymore its what i want
0,please youre just as ambitious as i am more
0,the work jesus ellie cant there just once be more to life than the work okay maybe thats the only way to get the recognition win the prizes
0,but the work
0,this is a chance to be of enormous help to other peoples research to have the power to be a real advocate where davids got blind spots
0,but what about your research
0,im going on staff at the nsf to work for drumlin
0,greenbank
0,im moving to washington
0,we could be together again
0,actually
0,peter if you can get him to do that for me hed obviously do the same for you we could
0,thirtyone linked dishes you could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here
0,the vla
0,what if i said i could get drumlin to agree to sell you time in new mexico
0,its almost there the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time
0,how close are you to getting this funding put together
0,if we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldnt even have the option of failing wed have to wonder our whole lives unable to do anything about it this time right now is unique in our history in any civilizations history the moment of the acquisition of technology the moment when contact becomes possible weve already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now
0,ellie even if you do manage to raise the money have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this i mean a college fetish is one thing but were talking about your career you wont be publishing you wont be taken seriously and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all
0,weve been going after some of the big multinationals but without much luck got a donation from a new york dowager weve even been thinking about selling tshirts
0,ive examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing still weve barely started
0,and
0,please any chance of that died the day david drumlin was appointed head of the nsf i have been in contact with a few other seti people weve been trying to find backing from private investors ive even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there
0,any luck on the grant money
0,i keep telling myself okay thats just the price you have to do your time doing shitwork before youre allowed to get to the good stuff but if i have to catalog one more quasar god ive missed you
0,is indistinguishable from magic
0,any sufficiently advanced technology
0,its like the precopernicans who swore the sun revolved around the earth or the victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made i mean try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us then imagine trying to explain i dunno a microwave oven to someone even a hundred years ago i mean the basic concepts didnt exist
0,they cant i think its against human nature to admit to that level of insignificance to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe
0,im just so sick of feeling defensive about the things i care about or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like drumlin when if theyd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts
0,what a coincidence it happens to be my fetish too
0,keep it down okay drumlin thinks im enough of a flake as it is look everyone here has their little fetishes caven goes to topless bars vernons got his carnivorous plants mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence
0,i read your paper on etis its brilliant
0,yavol
0,sounds like a russian general
0,peter valerian
0,ellie arroway
0,thats what they all say
0,hes an incredible prick but i never learned so much in my life
0,its beautiful but it does get a little lonely sometimes i think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isnt to avoid excess radio traffic but because were all such pathetic antisocial misfits speaking of which howre you getting on with the old man
0,drumlin said youre been down at arecibo for the last year
0,something my dad they said after all the suffering after all the desolation of the void the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other the one thing that makes it bearable is love
0,meaning
0,im not sure maybe it simply exists in the search for it maybe its something we have to make for ourselves
0,does that mean you think it doesnt exist
0,i dont know if it was a god it was searching for a greater one it was still searching for meaning
0,in other words
0,in other words god works in mysterious ways
0,maybe what you experienced cant be reduced to images on a videotape maybe they still plan to grant your request only in their own way in their own time or maybe its just like you said ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology
0,but it is a good question and i suppose ill always wonder about the answer why would they send me back without proof
0,ellie if you go out there like this if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didnt actually happen im afraid they really will crucify you please for your own sake for the sake of the world tell them what you know to be the truth tell them it really happened
0,i want to palmer more than anything but it has to be real it has to be true
0,have you seen whats happening out there the terror the despair the world is on fire ellie people need something they can believe in something worthy and you can give it to them
0,but
0,ellie the only one holding you to that standard is you the people want to hear your story they need to hear it
0,its not enough dont you understand i know it happened but by every standard of science by every standard ive lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point it may be true but it doesnt matter because i cant prove its real
0,ellie youre the proof you tell them your story ultimately theyll have no choice but to believe you
0,i dont have any proof palmer
0,it also makes god enormous i think of the scope of your universe ellie and it takes my breath away as it will everyone elses
0,youre sure you want to in the universe i saw were not exactly the stars of the show what happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small
0,i do
0,they dont believe me
0,im not sure its come to that
0,so im assuming they sent you here to administer last rites
0,pretty ironic huh i had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy just to find you
0,it was quite a page turner
0,im assuming you read my deposition
0,hi
0,hi
0,and yet thats always how i seem to end up isnt it if you really do love me palmer youll leave now please
0,ellie there is no reason you have to be alone
0,i cant hear this now
0,do you really think your life is meaningless eleanor is that why youre so quick to risk it because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose
0,i dont know
0,and then what then youll be safe
0,dont you understand i just have to hold it together just until tomorrow
0,im in love with you ellie
0,please
0,what are my other options in fifty years never
0,please palmer if you care for me at all dont push this now
0,what are you so afraid of
0,i cant do this
0,what
0,im sorry i cant
0,ellie what is it
0,what is it
0,im sorry
0,what
0,maybe thats okay
0,i do seem to be maybe because im just a little bit terrified about tomorrow
0,youre trembling
0,thank you
0,during the crusades pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show theyd actually been there i thought it sort of made sense that earth is now your holy land so
0,oh i brought you something
0,the final countdown
0,so the final countdown
0,i remember you were indelicate indiscreet and entirely less than tactful sound like anyone you know
0,ellie the last time we spoke i said some things
0,what if their answer is oh thats easy a thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape our population out of control violent crime no food so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anitsocial the weak the sick the unwanted and ever since weve been doing great
0,how do you mean
0,an excellent question doctor but what if we dont like the answer
0,another question i would ask would be a very simple one how did you do it how did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves
0,its late we should go back
0,ellie
0,what are you so afraid of ellie
0,its getting late
0,and yet youre willing to die for this cause the one thing thats given your life a sense of purpose dont you see the contradiction here
0,i dont know but as a scientist i have to consider that possibility
0,do you really believe your life is meaningless
0,maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isnt because science has obscured it maybe its just revealed it isnt there
0,i dont follow
0,did you ever stop to think that maybe that isnt sciences fault but meanings
0,i dont consider you the enemy ellie im not out to get technology i only ask the question does it have to have all the answers i look out there and i see so much emptiness people are so starved for meaning and its something they just dont seem to be getting from science
0,i thought it was wellwritten heartfelt and a little bit naive but thats just the enemys perspective
0,i wont deny i was ambitious when i had my experience i wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible im the first to admit that process included making some compromises you didnt answer my question
0,im more interested in the story behind the story how a young man goes from living on the streets of south boston to being the best selling media figure rubbing elbows with the president
0,whatd you think
0,losing faith the search for meaning in the age of reason catchy
0,really
0,i read your book
0,its what my whole lifes been aimed at the only thing thats given it a sense of purpose
0,youre willing to die for this
0,if you came back if you survived at all which its pretty certain you wouldnt
0,and everybody you care about would be dead and buried
0,something like that
0,if you came back youd only be four years older but over 50 years would have passed on earth
0,if you came back
0,relativity explain this to me one more time even if you traveled near the speed of light when you came back
0,in other words
0,in other words god is one hell of an engineer
0,its too elegant the degree of economy is extraordinary its really the next logical step even on earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature dna outclasses any computer we can come up with the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable
0,why
0,i dont think so
0,maybe youre creating a monster
0,not exactly it has organic qualities but we dont really understand how theyre integrated with the mechanical systems
0,some of my best friends are scientists theyre saying the machine is alive
0,i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors
0,some of my best friends are scientists
0,so is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this
0,prove it
0,yes very much
0,did you love him
0,i never knew my mother my father died when i was nine
0,do you love your parents
0,you may not believe this but theres a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your god to believe that were all here for a purpose that all this means something but its because that part of me wants it so badly that im so stubborn about making sure it isnt just selfdelusion of course i want to know god if there is one but it has to be real unless i have proof how can i be sure
0,look im a reasonable person and reasonably intelligent but this experience went beyond both for the first time i had to consider the possibility that intellect as wonderful as it is is not the only way of comprehending the universe that it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with
0,and theres no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it
0,i had an experience of belonging of unconditional love and for the first time in my life i wasnt terrified and i wasnt alone
0,can you try
0,its an old story i grew up in south boston more or less on the streets by the time i was thirteen id tried my first hit of heroin by fifteen id stopped using but i was dealing fulltime by the time i was nineteen i decided i didnt want to live any more at least not in a world like that one day i got on a bus i got as far as ohio before my money ran out and after that i just kept walking didnt eat didnt sleep just walked i ended up collapsing in a wheat field there was a storm i woke up and thats about as far as wordsll go
0,now you know
0,thats not doubt thats four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct i always wondered what you religious types did with your free time
0,only a tiny bit even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt
0,i flinched
0,so if i let the pendulum go when it swings back you wouldnt flinch
0,and mind yes what are you
0,and you believe this law with all your heart and soul
0,thats not faith its physics the second law of thermodynamics
0,your faith tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger only smaller
0,very smooth its palmer right where i came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards really though the bible describes a god who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old i look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies each with hundreds of billions of stars i mean burn me for a heretic but your god seems awfully small
0,my fathers house has many mansions
0,well its been a while but i dont recall the bible saying too much about alien civilizations
0,how do you mean
0,what about you doesnt all of this shake your faith at all
0,spoken like a true believer
0,i guess i wouldve felt sorry for the universe
0,and what would you have done if the odds had gone against you
0,id say logic more than faith the odds were on my side
0,what im curious about are the wilderness years youre out there all alone no money mocked by the skeptics it must have taken tremendous faith
0,make that two
0,champagne please
0,id have to say i dont know enough to have one yet for the moment i dont believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive
0,and where exactly does that put your position
0,i agree with mr rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here but i dont think it justifies taking an alarmist position dr arroway is right their chosen means of communication was a scientific one and a scientific approach is probably appropriate at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent
0,for managing the truth but the truth wont be managed sir it stops being the truth the moment you try
0,nobody is proposing we censor the truth here doctor were simply talking about putting a mechanism in place
0,i guess id say i trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of thanks for the advice but no thanks but to dilute or censor the truth for whatever reason
0,how would you propose we handle it doctor
0,you kill me you really do the first truly global apolitical event in history and you cant wait to spin it
0,yknow what fine i guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are theres no quicker way to show them
0,dr arroway you are entitled to your opinion but we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless
0,call it xenophobic paranoia dont you see the absolute absurdity of this this isnt about them its about us our violence our fear and mistrust
0,its designed purely as a defensive device call it a reasonable precaution
0,i question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed basically announcing our intentions are hostile
0,you have a question dr arroway
0,have your department make a full report
0,i dont know maybe we built the damn thing wrong maybe it was all a hoax the safest thing would probably be to do a chernobyl encase it in concrete
0,recommendations
0,as have all attempts at internal analysis weve tried sonargrams magnetic resonance gamma rays its completely impenetrable
0,thats it mike last time i checked i was still running the country although it seems that for the moment dr arroway is running the planet
0,but
0,well that would seem to decide it like it or not for the moment anyway it looks like were all in this together
0,what is it
0,oh my god
0,cut that backsass
0,but i made this arrangement
0,git movin i said

0,minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel the instrument panel was buckled inwards cracking the clock and the speedometer dials the cabin was deformed and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside the carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids
0,after being bombarded endlessly by road safety propaganda its almost a relief to have found myself inan actual accident

0,no what about your camera girl did she come
0,did you come
0,in the private aircraft hangar anybody could have walked in
0,where were you
0,yes they felt like traffic accidents
0,and did you fantasize that vaughan was photographing all these sex acts as though they were traffic accidents
0,yes i didnt plan it that way
1,and you had sex with all of these men in cars only in cars
0,the junior pathologist at ashford hospital then the husband of a colleague of mine then a trainee radiologist then the service manager at my garage
0,please finish your story
0,i dont know you can never be sure with vaughan this is his show
0,is this part of the act or are they really hurt
0,when i first met vaughan he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems i dont know what he is now
0,oh yes i thought he was a medical photographer doing some sort of accident research he wanted every conceivable detail about our crash
0,thats vaughan he talked to you at the hospital
0,who is that the announcer do i know him
0,thats the point besides i know i can give something now that i wasnt remotely aware of before its not a matter of duty so much as of commitment
0,isnt that rather too close
0,yes
0,the road research laboratory where they simulate car crashes
0,we sat in b massive traffic jam under an offramp i dont think we moved more than fifty yards im thinking of taking up a new job with the road research laboratory they need a medical officer the salary is larger something ive got to think about now theres a certain moral virtue in being materialistic im beginning to feel well its a new approach for me in any case
0,ive found that i enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic i like to look at it yesterday i hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour anywhere i said
0,are we imagining it
0,its much worse now you noticed that did you the day i left the hospital i had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason i didnt understand there seemed to be ten times as much traffic
0,look at all this traffic im not sure i can deal with it
0,do you want a cigarette i started to smoke at the hospital its rather stupid of me
0,i work in the immigration department there
0,so why the airport
0,ill wear a bloody kimono if i want to
0,i take it youre not wearing white to reassure them
0,not yet though not soon enough for some people ive already found a death in the doctors family makes the patients doubly uneasy
0,the airport why are you leaving
0,havent i to the airport if you could
0,you havent told me where were going
0,can i give you a lift i somehow find myself driving again
0,were you badly hurt i think we saw each other at the hospital i dont want the car in fact i was appalled to find that i have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped
0,i dont think we should have come here im surprised the police dont make it more difficult
0,they said it was here they told me this morning
0,its not here maybe the police are still holding it their forensic people
0,after this sort of thing how do people manage to look at a car let alone drive one im trying to find charless car
0,no thanks ill go with vaughan
0,im going to leave now do you want a lift
0,hard to say
0,what does he want from you
0,youre not jealous are you you have to understand helen and i had this strange intense experience together
0,serious but youll have to take your new friend the female crashtest dummy she dropped it off for you
0,youre kidding
0,i suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes you know jayne mansfield james dean albert camus
0,really what kind of exhibition is it
0,a complimentary ticket for a special stuntdriving exhibition definitely not part of the big auto show theres a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location
0,what is it
0,i can drive
0,can you drive
0,are you still involving me in your crash
0,you were the last one i saw just before the accident do you remember we made love
0,i saw the blood it looks like motor oil
0,theres still a patch of blood there on the road did you see it
0,im sure the police would make an exception in your case
0,no
0,are we allowed to park here
0,where are you
0,i need to see you ballard i need to talk to you about the project
0,youre right ballard theres an all night carwash in the airport service area
0,he must have driven through a pool of blood if the police stop you again they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood
0,a crude scifi concept that floats on the surface and doesnt threaten anybody i use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology
0,what about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology i thought that was your project
0,its the future ballard and youre already part of it for the first time a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us for example the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form to fully understand that and to live that that is my project
0,its very satisfying im not sure i understand why
0,the case could be made
0,is that why you drive this car i take it that you see kennedys assassination as a special kind of carcrash
0,no i mean a crash with a history camus facel vega or nathaniel nests station wagon grace kellys rover 3500 fix it just enough to get it rolling dont clean it dont touch anything else
0,you could get your wish at any moment
0,ive always wanted to drive a crashed car
0,its something were all intimately involved in the reshaping of the human body by modern technology
0,what exactly is your project vaughan book of crashes a medical study a sensational documentary global traffic
0,i live in my car this is my workshop
0,do you live here with seagrave
0,its not the police its the department of transport internal politics its a joke they have no idea who we really are
0,why are the police taking this all so seriously
0,yes
0,crash victim
0,oh
0,i have a goingaway gesture for you too
0,it was just a little goingaway gesture
0,ok good thats good thanks an awful lot for everything and for coming down here to see me off
0,so well meet every tuesday and friday and if you have any kind of emergency you can page me
0,are you saying im through with therapy
0,i think its about that time letty the charges against you have been dropped the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well
0,what
0,then you should call
0,i thought about calling but i want to wait until i know when ill be out
0,have you been in contact with the principal about your job
0,but what i really cant believe is that im starting to actually miss work
0,all i want you to do is think about whats best for you really think about it
0,first you tell me to do what i want to then you tell me to stop
0,i dont want to hear anymore
0,drugs can help suppress symptoms but lots of patients stop taking them when theyre on their own because the side effects are so harsh and michaels condition is often worsened by periods of stress hes been in and out of
0,look i know hes almost through with treatment here and hes on medication
0,then thats even more reason to listen look schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality they experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes
0,i dont need a lecture i care about michael
0,go ahead and put the guard back up letty but you need to know what youre dealing with
0,i know michaels a schizophrenic and mrs hallstroms manic depressive and john lockyer has episodes of psychosis and i heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur
0,what about michael do you know the extent of his
0,im a grown woman dr emlee i can take care of myself
0,well letty this does present a liability issue for the hospital
0,i couldnt really say anything because of that fraternizing rule
0,i miss beast a lot too
0,the question letty is how are you feeling
0,well see about adjusting the dosage if that doesnt clear in the next how are other things going
0,the medicines still bothering me it feels like i have cotton wrapped around my brain
0,i think in the spirit of group therapy its beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others
0,do we have to talk about this
0,i dont think you understand i wont wait
0,we discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind youve experienced
0,i want to see my mother immediately
0,i apologize for the inconvenience but i must ask you some
0,what kind of place is this
0,what
0,patient
0,psychologist therapist whatever
0,im afraid lhes not a doctor
0,yeah and a dimple
0,this doctor was he tall with dark hair
0,well i dont have hallucinations honest

0,its hospital policy

0,i agree with marcel i say we go to the airport and get on a plane
0,we cant
0,yeah we just go home
0,no problem
0,not a good idea someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you raymond youll steal one

0,we had a chance to walk out of zammitos house
0,what is that a threat are you fuckin threatening me marcel

0,you know what i mean im getting married soon but i havent lived the life i want
0,sure no place to bathe for days sleeping in fleainfested beds they tell you all about that in those books
0,but youre just like the characters in the stories
0,writers wouldnt sell many books if they told how it really is
0,ive read all about people like you roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way
0,fighters have rules too friendship trust integrity without rules we wouldnt survive for long
0,it must be exciting to be a fighter to be totally free
0,really
0,yes i am but i prefer the machete certain moves however call for a sword
0,youre a sword fighter too
0,youre too young to understand
0,li mu bai the famous warrior why would he give his sword to sir te
0,my friend li mu bai hes given it to sir te as a gift
0,exquisite you said it belongs to
0,beautiful but dangerous once you see it tainted with blood its beauty is hard to admire its 400 years old
0,but i have had much practice as a child in the west a platoon lived with us theyd let me play with their weapons the scabbard is so beautiful
0,the handle is heavy and the blade is no ordinary metal still the sword is the lightest of weapons youre just not used to handling it
0,its heavy for such a thin piece of metal
0,all right hurry i will hold on as long as i can
0,the antidote exists she taught it to me the formula is simple but it takes time to prepare trust me as you have helped me let me help you
0,then you have no use for the sword
0,never
0,kneel
0,give it back
0,all right if you can take back the sword in three moves ill go with you
0,what ive always wanted to teach you
0,what do you want
0,only the sword will settle this
0,lets end this here
0,not another lecture on guard
0,stop it you dont deserve the green destiny
0,make a wish lo
0,a faithful heart makes wishes come true
0,do you remember the legend of the young man
0,dont ever come back
0,jen
0,go
0,if you dont ill come after you and i wont let you off so easy
0,i will
0,keep it safe return it to me when we are together again
0,you must decide you might get tired of this life you might begin to miss your family if it were our daughter wed look for her too she would miss us jen i want you to be mine forever i will make my mark on the world i will earn your parents respect we have a legend anyone who dares to jump from the mountain god will grant his wish long ago a young mans parents were ill so he jumped he didnt die he wasnt even hurt he floated away far away never to return he knew his wish had come true if you believe it will happen the elders say a faithful heart makes wishes come true
0,dont send me back
0,it is trouble for me
0,let them look
0,your fathers men are still looking for you theyre still out there circling closer
0,i am a man and now ive found the brightest star of all
0,so youre still that little boy looking for shooting stars
0,out here you always fight for survival you have to be part of a gang to stand a chance slowly your gang becomes your family all that dark cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier
0,and so the little boy became a fearsome bandit he couldnt find the stars so he stole my comb
0,when i was a boy one night i saw a thousand shooting stars i thought where did they all go im an orphan i used to look for stars alone i thought if i rode to the other end of the desert id find them ive been riding in the desert ever since
0,give it back
0,i dont take orders from anyone
0,give me back my comb
0,im sorry i guessed wrong i though you were a han
0,by the way im a real manchurian
0,not true i can use it to pick fleas from my horse
0,its mine it means a lot to me a barbarian like you wouldnt understand
0,no more hitting on the head all this trouble for a comb
0,still in a bad mood at least youre speaking whats your name
0,you coward
0,youve got quite a temper its better this way
0,my comb
0,well there used to be whats your name im lo the hans call me dark cloud im not that tall or big but im quick as lightning
0,youre tired you need rest your horse needs water theres a creek up here
0,give it back
0,lets stop a moment
0,with all the traffic on your rooftop these days it took me a while to get in here i cant wait any longer i was wrong to let you go come back with me youll be happy in the desert youll be free there
0,you shouldnt have come
0,jen
0,lo
0,ive already wasted my whole life i want to tell you with my last breath i have always loved you i would rather be a ghost drifting by your side as a condemned soul than enter heaven without you because of your love i will never be a lonely spirit
0,use it to meditate free yourself from this world as you have been taught let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath do not waste it for me
0,my life is departing ive only one breath left
0,save your strength
0,shu lien
0,mu bai hold on give me some hope
0,that cant be everything has an antithesis why not this
0,my blood will soon reverse its flow its the same poison she used to kill my master there is no antidote
0,we followed jade fox
0,jade fox drugged her how did you get here
0,what happened
0,not a bad idea tonight well get a good nights sleep at headquarters
0,ill look around and catch up later
0,what about you
0,were close to your headquarters go home and check in
0,youre right but i dont know what to do i want to be with you just like this it gives me a sense of peace
0,to repress ones feelings only makes them stronger
0,giang hu is a world of tigers and dragons full of corruption i tried sincerely to give it up but i have brought us only trouble
0,your hand rough and callused from machete practice all this time ive never had the courage to touch it
0,not everything is an illusion my hand wasnt that real
0,shu lien the things we touch have no permanence my master would say there is nothing we can hold on to in this world only by letting go can we truly possess what is real
0,all right ill write you an introduction take it to wudan wait there for news from me
0,dont you want to see her again
0,shes out there but i doubt shell show herself well keep our eyes open sooner or later shell come for the girl
0,you think jade fox will show up
0,just be patient with me shu lien
0,i wish there were something more i could do to help you
0,i thought by giving away the sword i could escape the giang hu world but the cycle of bloodshed continues
0,its not our affair even if wudan accepts her her husband might object
0,for her they might make an exception if not im afraid shell become a poisoned dragon
0,but wudan does not accept women
0,thats not for her she should come to wudan and become a disciple
0,shes an aristocrats daughter shes not one of us in any case it will all be over soon youll kill fox and shell marry
0,she needs direction and training
0,i knew she would intrigue you
0,you did your job well but this girl i saw her last night
0,my job was to get the sword back without embarassing anyone i wasnt about to ruin her life or her fathers
0,true but i must borrow it for one last mission jade fox must die at its edge did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl
0,but its not your sword anymore you gave it to sir te
0,i admit getting it back makes me realize how much id missed it
0,well we had talked
0,then why did you come
0,i dont know it was stolen until i got here
0,what do you mean didnt you come back here for it
0,thats not what i meant i dont care about the sword
0,no id already sent them home you can blame me for losing the sword but please trust that ill get it back soon using my own methods
0,but your men are watching over yus compund
0,no not yet
0,have you questioned him yet
0,it was bo sir tes man i hear he followed the thief to the yus
0,it says jade fox is hiding at yus on the night of the theft there was a brawl near yus were you involved
0,no
0,did you see who posted it
0,be careful sir te requires discretion official business is difficult enough dont let personal feelings make it worse and i dont know even this poster could be some sort of trap
0,so i shall avenge my masters death after all
0,is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu
0,i didnt think shed dare come back to peking
0,you always suspected shed fled to the west
0,jade fox impossible
0,what have you discovered
0,but something is going on at the yu household
0,sir te believes its a ploy cast suspicion on governor yu
0,perhaps
0,join me once you have finished i can wait for you in peking
0,first i must visit my masters grave its been many years since jade fox murdered him i have yet to avenge his death and yet im thinking of quitting i must pray for his forgiveness
0,come with me to peking you can give the sword to sir te yourself itll be just like old times
0,so what will you do now
0,its time for me to leave it behind
0,you use it justly youre worthy of it
0,too many men have died at its edge it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade
0,i dont understand how can you part with it it has always been with you
0,i am he has always been our greatest protector
0,the green destiny sword youre giving it to sir te
0,perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me
0,were preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking
0,something i cant let go of you are leaving soon
0,what was it
0,no i didnt feel the bliss of enlightenment instead i was surrounded by an endless sorrow i couldnt bear it i broke off my meditation i couldnt go on there was something pulling me back
0,you were enlightened
0,during my meditation training i came to a place of deep silence i was surrounded by light time and space disappeared i had come to a place my master had never told me about
0,why youre a wudan fighter training is everything
0,i left the training early
0,the mountain must be so peaceful i envy you my work keeps me so busy i hardly get any rest
0,yes
0,monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain he said you were practicing deep meditation
0,fine
0,good and how are you
0,it has hows business
0,mu baiits been too long

0,a female criminal now thats news
0,yes the very killer of li mu bais own master last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her down
0,a murderer
0,no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking
0,but dont be too lenient
0,sir te knows that even wellmeaning people can make mistakes that can bring ruin to themselves and their families
0,thats good sometimes the help cant keep their hands to themselves its very embarassing
0,we know who stole the missing item if the thief returns it im sure sir te will pursue the matter no further
0,i heard sir te lost something and now madame tes not feeling well
0,im sorry shes not feeling well enough to receive you today
0,madam te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts shes being so considerate
0,father let me avenge my mothers death

0,we must avenge mother
0,its jade fox
0,the best way to trap a fox is through her cubs
0,what do you have in mind
0,sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter
0,this is a delicate matter
0,we must be careful governor yu is a court official and in charge of security any disturbance will cast suspicion on him it might get sir te in trouble
0,then someones trying to set him up we should inform li mu bai
0,but the sword could be in his compound
0,yes though i doubt hes involved in this
0,has governor yu ever seen the sword
0,when it comes to emotions even great heroes can be idiots tell me if li mu bai is not more open the next time you see him ill give him an earful
0,i beg your pardon li mu bai and i arent cowards

0,once the emptiness in amys life is filled the dream will go of itself if a up to you both of you only you two can bring her into a real world you must give her the friendship and love she craves
0,how
0,its perfectly normal for a child to dream i can see how a sensitive little girl finding this portrait would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend that image dwells only in her imagination and that image can go as quickly as it was born
0,i can see it allthe very day it began amy was lonely she was desperate for friendship i remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring that must have been the day she first wished for a friend
0,what do you mean
0,forgive me but it was superstition foolish childish wishesthat started all this
0,its been ages since ive even thought of a mummers play when i was in college we used to do them every year — st george and the dragon all kinds of sword dances

0,thats exactly what i told mr reed but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you miss callahan
0,to a situation really mr reed there isnt anything to worry about it was only a slap
0,all right amy go tell edward to take you
0,but it wont be christmas tomorrow

0,the farren house
0,on the back street — a green house
0,someone gave it to you where was this old house
0,at the old house with the voice
0,but where did you get it amy
0,thats what i wished on edward says its a wishing ring and it is

0,i know dear i understand but try to worry a little less about her be a little easier in your thinking and especially today — lets forget about it we want a really bangup birthday party dont we
0,no its not that its because i know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves imagine things i love amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals i saw what happened to irena with her cat people
0,thats why i can tell you straight out you think too much about irena blame yourself for her death and its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about amy
